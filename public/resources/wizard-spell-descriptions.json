Besides causing damage to creatures, the ''fireball'' ignites all combustible materials within its burst radius, and the heat of the ''fireball'' melts soft metals such as gold, copper, silver, etc. Exposed items require saving throws vs. magical fire to determine if they are affected, but items in the possession of a creature that rolls a successful saving throw are unaffected by the ''fireball''.\n\nThe wizard points his finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the ''fireball'' is to burst.

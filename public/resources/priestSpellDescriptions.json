        "Introduction": "This spell causes a luminous glow within 20 feet of the spell's center. The area of light thus caused is equal in brightness to torchlight. Objects in darkness beyond this sphere can be seen, at best, as vague and shadowy shapes. The spell is centered on a point selected by the caster, and he must have a line of sight or unobstructed path to that point when the spell is cast. Light can spring from air, rock, metal, wood, or almost any similar substance. The effect is immobile unless it is specifically centered on a movable object or mobile creature. If this spell is cast upon a creature, any applicable magic resistance and saving throws must be rolled. Successful resistance negates the spell, while a successful saving throw indicates that the spell is centered immediately behind the creature, rather than upon the creature itself. A light spell centered on the visual organs of a creature blinds it, reducing its attack and saving throw rolls by 4 and worsening its Armor Class by 4. The caster can extinguish the light at any time by uttering a single word. Light spells are not cumulative—multiple castings do not provide a brighter light.\n\nThe spell is reversible, causing darkness in the same area and under the same conditions as the light spell, but with half the duration. Magical darkness is equal to that of an unlit interior room—pitch darkness. Any normal light source or magical light source of lesser intensity than full daylight does not function in magical darkness. A darkness spell cast directly against a light spell cancels both, and vice versa.\n\nNotes: Common for clerics (PHB)."

      "sections": {
        "Introduction": "This spell allows a priest to sense how far a character, creature, object, or area is from a condition of balance—in other words, the degree to which its alignment is removed from true Neutral. The spell gives no indication of the \"direction\" in which the alignment is removed from true Neutral except under certain conditions which follow. The spell does, however, indicate along which axis or axes of alignment the variation lies.\n\nFor example, a priest uses this spell to analyze the balance of a Chaotic Neutral creature. The spell indicates that the creature is removed from Neutral by one grade, and the variation is along the Law/Chaos axis; thus, the creature must be either Chaotic Neutral or Lawful Neutral. If the creature were Chaotic Evil, the spell would indicate that it is removed from balance by two grades, one along each axis; thus, the creature must be Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Good, Lawful Evil, or Lawful Good.\n\nA priest has a 5% chance per level of correctly determining the direction of variation along one randomly chosen axis. This means that a 10th-level priest evaluating the balance of a Chaotic Neutral creature would have a 50% chance of learning that the creature is Chaotic (and hence Chaotic Neutral, since it is only one step away from balance).\n\nSimilar to spells such as detect evil, this spell will not yield a result on a hidden trap. If cast on a creature with an intelligence level of \"animal\" or \"non-,\" it will always read true Neutral (i.e., zero steps removed from balance).\n\nThe material components are four iron coins which the priest tosses in his hand while concentrating on the spell. The coins are not consumed in the casting.\n\nNotes: Common for to priests with access to the spheres of Divination and Numbers."

        "Introduction": "By means of this spell, the caster is able to show any animal of animal intelligence to semi-intelligence (i.e., Intelligence 1-4) that he desires friendship. If the animal does not roll a successful saving throw vs. spell immediately when the spell is begun, it stands quietly while the caster finishes the spell. Thereafter, it follows the caster about. The spell functions only if the caster actually wishes to be the animal's friend. If the caster has ulterior motives, the animal always senses them (for example, the caster intends to eat the animal, send it ahead to set off traps, etc.).\n\nThe caster can teach the befriended animal three specific tricks or tasks for each point of Intelligence it possesses. Typical tasks are those taught to a dog or similar pet (i.e., they cannot be complex). Training for each such trick must be done over a period of one week, and all must be done within three months of acquiring the creature. During the three-month period, the animal will not harm the caster, but if the creature is left alone for more than a week, it will revert to its natural state and act accordingly.\n\nThe caster can use this spell to attract up to 2 Hit Dice of animal(s) per experience level he possesses. This is also the maximum total Hit Dice of the animals that can be attracted and trained at one time: no more than twice the caster's experience level. Only unaligned animals can be attracted, befriended, and trained.\n\nThe material components of this spell are the caster's holy symbol and a piece of food liked by the animal.\n\nNotes: Common for druids (PHB)."

        "Introduction": "This spell enhances the caster’s movement capabilities in extraplanar settings by attuning him to his new surroundings. While very few 1st-level priests find themselves in this situation, higher level characters often make use of this spell. Astral celerity doubles the character’s movement rate on the Astral Plane; normally, characters move at a rate of 30 times their Intelligence score in feet per round, but this spell increases this to 60 feet times their Intelligence score. As an incidental benefit, the caster also attunes himself to the plane much faster and suffers no penalties for missile fire while astral.\n\nWhile astral celerity is most often used in the astral plane, it also offers a small benefit to ethereal characters, too: their movement rates are increased by 50%, so a character with a movement rate of 12 would enjoy a movement rate of 18 while this spell was in effect. Of course, time and distance have little meaning in the overall scheme of the Astral or Ethereal Planes, but relative speed could be very important in avoiding an unpleasant encounter or escaping from pursuit of some kind.\n\nNotes: Uncommon spell (PO:SM)."

Furthermore, it raises their attack dice rolls by +1. A blessing, however, affects only those not already engaged in melee combat. The caster determines at what range (up to 60 yards) he will cast the spell. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 50-foot cube centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not).\n\nA second use of this spell is to bless a single item (for example, a crossbow bolt for use against a rakshasa). The weight of the item is limited to one pound per caster level and the effect lasts until the item is used or the spell duration ends.\n\nMultiple bless spells are not cumulative. In addition to the verbal and somatic gesture components, the bless spell requires holy water.\n\nThis spell can be reversed by the priest to a curse spell that, when cast upon enemy creatures, lowers their morale and attack rolls by -1. The curse requires the sprinkling of unholy water.\n\nNotes: Common for all priests (PHB)."

The caster can affect any animals he wishes to within the spell’s range, but all the subjects must be of the same species. The subject creatures are not allowed a saving throw unless they have magical powers, abilities, or are clearly not entirely natural; a priest could calm a normal bear, war dog, or wolf with little trouble, but it’s more difficult to affect a winter wolf, hell hound, or owlbear.\n\nWhile under the influence of this spell, the affected creatures remain where they are and do not attack or flee, unless they are attacked or confronted by a significant hazard such as a fire or a hungry predator.

Character alignment, however, is revealed only under unusual circumstances: characters who are strongly aligned, who do not stray from their faith, and who are of at least 9th level might radiate good or evil if intent upon appropriate actions. Powerful monsters, such as rakshasas or ki-rin, send forth emanations of evil or good, even if polymorphed. Aligned undead radiate evil, for it is this power and negative force that enable them to continue existing. An evilly cursed object or unholy water radiates evil, but a hidden trap or an unintelligent viper does not.\n\nThe degree of evil (dim, faint, moderate, strong, or overwhelming) and possibly its general nature (expectant, malignant, gloating, etc.) can be noted. If the evil is overwhelming, the priest has a 10% chance per level of detecting its general bent (lawful, neutral, or chaotic). The duration of a detect evil (or detect good) spell is one turn plus five rounds per level of the priest. Thus, a 1st-level priest can cast a spell with a 15-round duration, a 2nd-level priest can cast a spell with a 20-round duration, etc. The spell has a path of detection 10 feet wide in the direction the priest is facing. The priest must concentrate—stop, have quiet, and intently seek to detect the aura—for at least one round to receive a reading.\n\nThe spell requires the use of the priest's holy symbol as its material component, with the priest holding it before him.\n\nThe reverse spell, detect good, operates the same way, but good emanations are discovered.\n\nNotes: Common for clerics (PHB)."

Such hazards include simple pits, deadfalls, snares of wilderness creatures (for example, trapdoor spiders, giant sundews, ant lions, etc.), and primitive traps constructed of natural materials (mantraps, missile trips, hunting snares, etc.). The spell is directional—the caster must face the desired direction to determine if a pit exists or a trap is laid in that direction. The caster experiences a feeling of danger from the direction of a detected hazard, which increases as the danger is approached. The caster learns the general nature of the danger (pit, snare, or deadfall) but not its exact operation, nor how to disarm it. Close examination, however, enables the caster to sense what intended actions might trigger it. The spell detects certain natural hazards—quicksand (snare), sinkholes (pit), or unsafe walls of natural rock (deadfall). Other hazards, such as a cavern that floods during rain, an unsafe construction, or a naturally poisonous plant, are not revealed. The spell does not detect magical traps (save those that operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring; see the 2nd-level spell trip and the 3rd-level spell snare), nor those that are mechanically complex, nor those that have been rendered safe or inactive.\n\nThe caster must have his holy symbol to complete the spell.\n\nNotes: Common for druids (PHB)."

This reading is neither deep nor specific and cannot pick out mixed emotions or intricate details. For example, it might tell the priest that the subject is fearful, but the spell cannot reveal what the subject is afraid of or why he is afraid.\n\nEmotion read does not reveal individual thoughts or the subject's motivation. Thus, the spell might reveal that the subject is coldly unemotional at the moment, but not the fact that the subject is contemplating the cold-blooded murder of the priest.\n\nNote that this reading is instantaneous. It reveals only the emotion that is strongest at the instant the spell is used. While this will usually be related to the subject's overall emotional state, it is always possible that the subject might be distracted for a moment or remember and respond to past events.\n\nThe subject is allowed a normal saving throw vs. spells to resist this spell. If the saving throw is successful, the priest receives no reading at all. If the subject's roll exceeds the necessary number by six or more, the priest perceives an emotion diametrically opposite to the subject's true emotion.\n\nThe material component is a square of unmarked white wax.\n\nNotes: Common for a priest with access to the sphere of Thought."

Note that the protection does not prevent a vampire's charm itself, nor end it, but it does prevent the vampire from exercising mental control through the barrier. Likewise, an outside life force is merely kept out, and would not be expelled if in place before the protection was cast.\n\nThird, the spell prevents bodily contact by creatures of an extraplanar or conjured nature (such as aerial servants, elementals, imps, invisible stalkers, salamanders, water weirds, xorn, and others). This causes the natural (body) weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creature to recoil if such attacks require touching the protected creature. Animals or monsters summoned or conjured by spells or similar magic are likewise hedged from the character. This protection ends if the protected character makes a melee attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.\n\nTo complete this spell, the priest uses holy water or burning incense.\n\nThis spell can be reversed to become protection from good, with the second and third benefits remaining unchanged.\n\nThe material components for the reverse are a circle of unholy water or smoldering dung.\n\nNotes: Common for clerics (PHB).\n\nThis spell does not specifically hedge out undead creatures (except ghouls, as stated in the Monstrous Manual tome), unless these have been brought by a monster summoning spell or equivalent magic or are from another plane."

At the end of the casting, the priests involved join hands, thus completing the spell. If any priest breaks the circle, the spell immediately ceases. The priests may not move from their locations but are free to speak. They may not cast spells requiring a somatic or material component while the ring is formed.\n\nThe ring of hands forms a protective barrier around the priests and everything within their circle. For each priest, assume a five-foot circumference of the circle; thus, three priests would create a circle of 15-foot circumference. For easy calculation, assume that for each priest, the circle can accommodate four persons.\n\nThe barrier functions as a protection from evil spell. Attacks by evil creatures suffer a -1 penalty for every priest forming the circle. Saving throws made by the priests or anyone in the circle against attacks from such creatures receive a +1 bonus for every priest in the circle.\n\nAttempts at mental control over protected creatures are blocked. Extraplanar and conjured creatures are unable to touch the priests and those within the circle, although melee attacks against such creatures by those within the ring break the barrier.\n\nBecause the priests casting the spell cannot move and must hold hands, they do not receive any Dexterity bonuses to Armor Class.\n\nFurthermore, opponents gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against the priests, since there is little they can do to avoid a blow. Creatures within the ring are free to act as they wish. Melee attacks by those within the ring are limited to piercing weapons and suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls since the priests intervene.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, ring of woe, functions as detailed above except the effect applies to good creatures as would a protection from good spell.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for clerics (ToM)."

When this happens, the thought object stays in the geographical area where it was lost. Any receptive brain (usually the brain of the creature that initially created the thought) can pick it up again simply by bumping into the invisible, free-floating thought. According to the theory, this is the reason that people can regain a lost thought by going back to the location where the thought was lost.

Unfortunately for philosophers who disagree with this, thought capture seems to be extremely strong evidence for this theory.\n\nThis spell makes the priest's brain something of a magnet that attracts thought objects in close proximity. The priest can sense strong thoughts and emotions and can sometimes even see momentary visions of creatures who died or suffered some powerful emotion in the immediate vicinity.

Thus, a 10th-level fighter is included, while an ogre is not.\n\nThe spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but any word or action of the caster is viewed in the most favorable way. Thus, a charmed creature would not obey a suicide command, but might believe the caster if assured that the only chance to save the caster's life is for the creature to hold back an onrushing red dragon for “just a minute or two” and if the charmed creature's view of the situation suggests that this course of action still allows a reasonable chance of survival.\n\nThe subject's attitudes and priorities are changed with respect to the caster, but basic personality and alignment are not. A request that a victim make itself defenseless, give up a valued item, or even use a charge from a valued item (especially against former associates or allies) might allow an immediate saving throw to see if the charm is thrown off. Likewise, a charmed creature does not necessarily reveal everything it knows or draw maps of entire areas. Any request may be refused, if such refusal is in character and does not directly harm the caster. The victim's regard for the caster does not necessarily extend to the caster's friends or allies. The victim does not react well to the charmer's allies making suggestions such as, “Ask him this question...,” nor does the charmed creature put up with verbal or physical abuse from the charmer's associates, if this is out of character.\n\nNote also that the spell does not empower the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond those he normally has. The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed creature's Intelligence, and it is tied to the saving throw. A successful saving throw breaks the spell. This saving throw is checked on a periodic basis according to the creature's Intelligence, even if the caster has not overly strained the relationship.\n\nIf the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed creature by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed creature, the charm is broken automatically.\n\nIf the subject of the charm person/charm mammal spell successfully rolls its saving throw vs. the spell, the effect is negated.\n\nThis spell, if used in conjunction with the animal friendship spell, can keep the animal near the caster's home base, if the caster must leave for an extended period.\n\nNotes: Common for druids (PHB)."

The dust devil appears as a small whirlwind 1 foot in diameter at its base, 5 feet tall, and 3 to 4 feet across at the top. It moves as directed by the priest, but dissipates if it is ever separated from the caster by more than 30 yards. Its winds are sufficient to put out torches, small campfires, exposed lanterns, and other small, open flames of nonmagical origin. The dust devil can hold a gas cloud or a creature in gaseous form at bay or push it away from the caster (though it cannot damage or disperse such a cloud). If skimming along the ground in an area of loose dust, sand, or ash, the dust devil picks up those particles and disperses them in a 10-foot-diameter cloud centered on itself. The cloud obscures normal vision, and creatures caught within are blinded while inside and for one round after they emerge. A spellcaster caught in the dust devil or its cloud while casting must make a saving throw vs. spell to keep his concentration, or the spell is ruined.

Those enthralled take no action while the priest speaks, and for 1d3 rounds thereafter while they discuss the matter.

        "Introduction": "The ethereal barrier is a defense against the passage of extradimensional creatures, including characters or monsters that are phased, ethereal, or travelling via dimension door or shadow walk. The priest creates an imperceptible barrier of 10 square feet per level that may be arranged in any fashion the priest desires. For example, a 3rd-level character can ward six 10-foot by 10-foot surfaces, which would be sufficient to guard a 10-foot by 10-foot by 10-foot room (four walls, a ceiling, and a floor need to be protected.) Note that some monsters may be capable of abandoning their ethereal approach in order to simply enter the barred area on their own feet—the ethereal barrier only bars their passage as long as they are traveling in the Border Ethereal. Also, while this spell can’t be worn down by any form of attack, it does not bar teleportation, gates, or the passage of astral creatures.\n\nEthereal barrier may be cast as cooperative magic by several priests working together. As long as all involved characters can cast the spell, the areas of effect of each priest are added together. Total the levels of all priests involved and multiply by two to find the number of 10-foot by 10-foot squares that may be warded. For example, four 6th-level casters (24 total levels) can ward 48 10-foot by 10-foot squares. The duration is determined by the highest level priest involved, plus 1 turn for each additional priest. In the previous example, this would be 6 turns plus 3 turns for three additional priests for a total of 9 turns.\n\nThis spell is also suitable for focus magic (see the spell focus in the Tome of Magic ).\n\nThe material component is a special compound of rare earths and lead worth at least 10 gp per application. One application is required for each 10-foot by 10-foot square to be warded.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for any priest with access to the spheres of Astral or Wards (PO:SM)."

Thus, traps include alarms, glyphs, and similar spells or devices.\n\nThe caster learns the general nature of the trap (magical or mechanical) but not its exact effect, nor how to disarm it. Close examination will, however, enable the caster to sense what intended actions might trigger it. Note that the caster's divination is limited to his knowledge of what might be unexpected and harmful. The spell cannot predict actions of creatures (hence, a concealed murder hole or ambush is not a trap), nor are natural hazards considered traps (a cavern that floods during a rain, a wall weakened by age, a naturally poisonous plant, etc.). If the DM is using specific glyphs or sigils to identify magical wards (see the 3rd-level spell glyph of warding), this spell shows the form of the glyph or mark.

While meditating, the priest can keep watch on his surroundings, but he suffers a +1 penalty to any surprise checks. If the character wishes to memorize spells, he must sleep normally.\n\nAt the vigil’s end, the priest must eat and drink; if no food or water is available, the character must make a Constitution check once every four hours at a cumulative –1 penalty or fall into a coma and perish within 1d3 days if he receives no aid.\n\nThe priest also requires at least four hours of rest for each day without food, drink, or sleep during the vigil.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for clerics (PO:SM)."

Mind read will always reveal the kind of creature being probed, although this identity may be couched in the creature's own language or in a (possibly distorted) body image. The spell has a 20% chance of revealing the character class of an individual.\n\nThe details and the usefulness of the creature's thoughts will depend on the intelligence of the subject. While a priest could read the thoughts of an animal, he would probably receive only a confused jumble of emotions and instincts. Reading the mind of a highly intelligent wizard, however, would be much more illuminating; the priest might be amazed by the crystal clarity and deep insight of the wizard's mental processes.\n\nIf mind read is used as part of an interrogation, an intelligent and wary subject receives a saving throw at a -2 penalty. If successful, the creature resists the spell's effects and the priest learns no information. If the saving throw is failed, the priest may learn additional information according to the DM's ruling.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with access to the sphere of Thought (ToM)."

While the music spell is in effect, the subject saves against charm spells with a -3 penalty.\n\nThis spell does not protect other characters in company with the priest; listeners who have fallen prey to the music are free to attack anyone else. The spell effect ends instantly if the priest takes any hostile action against a creature under the influence of the spell.\n\nMusic of the spheres can affect one creature per three levels of the priest (one subject at 3rd level, two at 6th level, etc.). Subjects must be within a 20-foot-diameter circle.\n\nPotential victims must have Intelligence of at least 1 (necessary to understand the concept of music) and must be able to hear the music (i.e., they cannot be deaf and there can be nothing obstructing the victim's ears). This also means that the level of background noise must be low enough for the music to be audible. The DM should assume that the music is the same volume as an average human's normal speaking voice.\n\nIf the potential subject could not hear speech at the appropriate range under prevailing conditions, the spell cannot affect that subject. The spell would be virtually useless in the midst of a full-scale battle or during a hurricane.\n\nThe material component comprises a set of three small bows made from fine silver, each costing 100 gp. The lengths of the bows must be in the ratio of 1 to 4 to 9. The priest strokes these bows together in an intricate sequence while casting the spell. The bows are not consumed in the casting.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with major access to the sphere of Numbers (ToM)."

        "Introduction": "By calling upon his deity, the caster of a spiritual hammer spell brings into existence a field of force shaped vaguely like a hammer. As long as the caster concentrates upon the hammer, it strikes at any opponent within its range, as desired. Each round the caster can choose to attack the same target as the previous round or switch to a new target that he can see anywhere within his maximum range. The spiritual hammer's chance to successfully hit is equal to that of the caster, without any Strength bonuses. In addition, it strikes as a magical weapon with a bonus of +1 for every six experience levels (or fraction) of the spellcaster, up to a total of +3 to the attack roll and +3 to the damage roll for a 13th-level caster. The base damage inflicted when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer (1d4+1 points on opponents of man size or smaller, or 1d4 points on larger opponents, plus the magical bonus). The hammer strikes in the same direction as the caster is facing, so if he is behind the target, all bonuses for rear attack are gained along with the loss of any modifications to the target's AC for shield and Dexterity.\n\nAs soon as the caster ceases concentration, the spiritual hammer spell ends. A dispel magic spell that includes either the caster or the force in its area of effect has a chance to dispel the spiritual hammer. If an attacked creature has magic resistance, the resistance is checked the first time the spiritual hammer strikes. If the hammer is successfully resisted, the spell is lost. If not, the hammer has its normal full effect for the duration of the spell.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a normal war hammer that the priest must hurl toward opponents while uttering a plea to his deity. The hammer disappears when the spell is cast.\n\nNotes: Common for clerics (PHB)."

Note that only as many creatures can be tripped as are actually stepping across the enchanted object. Thus, a 3-foot-long piece of rope could trip only one man-sized creature. Creatures moving at a very rapid pace (running) when tripped suffer 1 point of damage and are stunned for 1d4+1 rounds if the surface they fall upon is very hard (if it is turf or other soft material, they are merely stunned for the rest of that round). Very large creatures, such as elephants, are not affected at all by a trip spell. The object continues to trip all creatures passing over it, including the spellcaster, for as long as the spell duration lasts. A creature aware of the object and its potential adds a +4 bonus to its saving throw roll when crossing the object. The enchanted object is 80% undetectable unless a means that detects magical traps is employed or the operation of the spell is observed.

The range of a warp wood spell is 10 yards for each level of experience of the caster. It affects approximately a 15- inch shaft of wood of up to 1-inch diameter per level of the caster. Thus, at 1st level, a caster might be able to warp a hand axe handle or four crossbow bolts; at 5th level, he could warp the shaft of a typical spear. Note that boards or planks can also be affected, causing a door to be sprung or a boat or ship to leak. Warped missile weapons are useless; warped melee weapons suffer a -4 penalty to their attack rolls.\n\nEnchanted wood is affected only if the spellcaster is of higher level than the caster of the prior enchantment. The spellcaster has a 20% cumulative chance of success per level of difference (20% if one level higher, 40% if two levels higher, etc.). Thus, a door magically held or wizard locked by a 5th-level wizard is 40% likely to be affected by a warp wood spell cast by a 7th-level priest. Wooden magical items are considered enchanted at 12th level (or better).\n\nExtremely powerful items, such as artifacts, are unaffected by this spell.\n\nThe reversed spell, straighten wood, straightens bent or crooked wood, or reverses the effects of a warp wood spell, subject to the same restrictions.\n\nNotes: Common for druids (PHB)."

(The DM should allow the player one minute of real time per round withdrawn to ponder some problem or question. No discussion with other players is permitted.) Note that while affected by the withdraw spell, the caster can use only the following spells: any divination spell or any curing or healing spell, the latter on himself only. The casting of any of these spells in different fashion (for example, a cure light wounds spell bestowed upon a companion) negates the withdraw spell. Similarly, the withdrawn caster cannot walk or run, become invisible, or engage in actions other than thinking, reading, and the like.

A successful saving throw indicates that the subject creature was missed by the attack of the wyvern-form, and the spell remains in place. As soon as a subject creature is successfully struck by the wyvern-form, the paralysis takes effect and the force of the spell dissipates. The spell force likewise dissipates if no intruder is struck by the wyvern-form for eight hours after the spell is cast.

The skeletons or zombies can follow the caster, remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature) entering the place, etc. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed in combat or are turned; the magic cannot be dispelled.\n\nThe priest can animate one skeleton or one zombie for each experience level he has attained. If creatures with more than 1+ Hit Dice are animated, the number is determined by the monster Hit Dice. Skeletal forms have the Hit Dice of the original creature, while zombie forms have 1 more Hit Die. Thus, a 12th-level priest could animate 12 dwarven skeletons (or six zombies), four zombie gnolls, or a single zombie fire giant. Note that this is based on the standard racial Hit Die norm; thus, a high-level adventurer would be animated as a skeleton or zombie of 1 or 2 Hit Dice, and without special class or racial abilities. The caster can, alternatively, animate two small animal skeletons (1-1 Hit Die or less) for every level of experience he has achieved.\n\nThe spell requires a drop of blood, a piece of flesh of the type of creature being animated, and a pinch of bone powder or a bone shard to complete the spell.

If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed in a light-proof covering, the spell effects are blocked until the covering is removed.\n\nContinual light brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) cancels the darkness so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.

Ordering an animal to engage in combat is not necessarily self-destructive, as long as the prospective opponent is not more than three times the animal’s Hit Dice or more than two size categories larger than the subject.

Because the caster’s intelligence directs the animal, the creature may be able to take actions normally beyond its own comprehension, such as manipulating objects with its paws and mouth. The caster need not concentrate in order to maintain control of the creature unless he is trying to direct it to do something it normally couldn’t.\n\nControl animal only works on normal or giant-sized animals with Intelligence ratings between 1 and 4. Magical animals, monsters, and creatures of low Intelligence or higher are immune to the effects of this spell. Druids always avoid using this spell.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for priests with access to the Animal sphere; barred to druids."

The affliction rapidly disappears thereafter, making the cured creature whole and well in from one turn to 10 days, depending on the type of disease and the state of its advancement when the cure took place. (The DM must adjudicate these conditions.) The spell is also effective against parasitic monsters such as green slime, rot grubs, and others. When cast by a priest of at least 12th level, this spell cures lycanthropy if cast within three days of the infection. Note that the spell does not prevent reoccurrence of a disease if the recipient is again exposed.\n\nThe reverse of the cure disease spell is cause disease. To be effective, the priest must touch the intended victim, and the victim must fail a saving throw vs. spell. The severity of the disease is decided by the priest (debilitating or fatal). The exact details of the disease are decided by the DM, but the following are typical:\n\nDebilitating: The disease takes effect in 1d6 turns, after which the creature loses 1 point of Strength per hour until his Strength is reduced to 2 or less, at which time the recipient is weak and virtually helpless. If a creature has no Strength rating, it loses 10% of its hit points per Strength loss, down to 10% of its original hit points. If the disease also affects hit points, use the more severe penalty. Recovery requires a period of 1d3 weeks.\n\nFatal: This wasting disease is effective immediately. Infected creatures receive no benefit from cure wound spells while the disease is in effect; wounds heal at only 10% of the natural rate. The disease proves fatal within 1d6 months and can be cured only by magical means. Each month the disease progresses, the creature loses 2 points of Charisma, permanently.\n\nThe inflicted disease can be cured by the cure disease spell. Lycanthropy cannot be caused.\n\nNotes: Common for clerics and druids (PHB)."

The caster is not limited to a single word and can issue an order of no more than a dozen words in length. All the specified targets who fail their saving throws must attempt to obey the caster’s instructions. For example, a priest could issue a dictate such as “Stay here until I return,” “Throw down your weapons,” or “Seize that elf!” The subjects will continue to obey nonimmediate orders for up to one round per experience level of the caster.\n\nSubjects who cannot understand the caster are not affected, so characters who do not understand the caster’s language are immune to this spell. In addition, the order must create an immediate and obvious course of action for the subject; a dictate to “Die!” or “Feel sorry for him!” would simply cause the subject to stand still in confusion for one round. Poorly worded or confusing commands grant the subjects a +1 to +4 bonus on their saving throws at the DM’s discretion. Similarly, if after the subject fails his saving throw he is given an obviously self-destructive dictate, the subject simply loses his next round as he fights off the compulsion.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for clerics and priests with access to the sphere of Charm or Law."

        "Introduction": "When a priest casts this spell, it has a chance to neutralize or negate the magic it comes in contact with as follows:\n\nFirst, it has a chance to remove spells and spell-like effects (including device effects and innate abilities) from creatures or objects. Second, it may disrupt the casting or use of these in the area of effect at the instant the dispel is cast. Third, it may destroy magical potions (which are treated as 12th level for purposes of this spell).\n\nEach effect or potion in the spell's area is checked to determine if it is dispelled. The caster can always dispel his own magic; otherwise, the chance depends on the difference in level between the magical effect and the caster. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 11 or higher on 1d20. If the caster is of higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted from this base number needed. If the caster is of lower level, the difference is added to the base. A die roll of 20 always succeeds and a die roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is trying to dispel, only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled.\n\nA dispel magic can affect only a specially enchanted item (such as a magical scroll, ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous item, weapon, shield, or armor) if it is cast directly upon the item. This renders the item nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An item possessed or carried by a creature has the creature's saving throw against this effect; otherwise, it is automatically rendered nonoperational. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) rendered nonoperational is temporarily closed. Note that an item's physical properties are unchanged: A nonoperational magical sword is still a sword.\n\nArtifacts and relics are not subject to this spell, but some of their spell-like effects may be, at the DM's option.\n\nNote that this spell, if successful, will release charmed and similarly beguiled creatures. Certain spells or effects cannot be dispelled; these are listed in the spell descriptions.\n\nNotes: Common for clerics and druids (PHB).\n\n\n * * Effect negated; if cast directly on item, item becomes nonoperational for 1d4 rounds.",
        "High-Level Campaigns Book Addition": "Dispel Magic: A dispel magic spell cast directly upon an unattended magical item automatically renders the item inoperable for 1d4 rounds. If dispel magic is cast upon an item that is in the possession of another creature, the item is unaffected by the dispelling attempt if the creature makes a successful saving throw versus spell. If the creature fails its saving throw, the item is rendered inert for 1d4 rounds.\n\nTemporary effects from potions can be dispelled, see the section on potions for details.\n\nPermanent spells must be individually targeted to be dispelled, requiring a separate dispel magic for each permanent effect. Unlike a magical item, a permanent spell is destroyed, not temporarily rendered nonoperational, by a successful dispel magic. A creature or item never gains a saving throw to avoid a dispelling attempt against its permanent effects, but the dispel magic is not automatically successful either. The caster of the dispel magic must still be of higher level than the caster of the permanency spell, and he must still make a successful dispelling roll. More detailed information is found at the permanency spell description.\n\nCasting dispel magic on a creature or object does not radiate an area of effect. Thus, spells such as stoneskin, minor globe of invulnerability, and barkskin could not be dispelled as the result of trying to negate the magic of a wand of lightning.\n\nSpells and potions whose basic durations are permanent cannot be dispelled. A cure light wounds spell or potion of extra-healing, cannot be dispelled after their healing properties have occurred. A potion of heroism could be negated while its effects were in operation, however.\n\nA successful dispel magic versus a 10th-level spell temporarily negates the spell’s effect for 1d4 rounds. It has no effect against a permanent 10th-level spell cast on a creature."

Sadness counters (and is countered by) happiness.\n\nAll subjects of the second version, even willing targets, must save vs. spell to resist the emotion.

Secondly, the priest may not use this spell on an unwilling target and can only make another creature ethereal if the subject is willing and in physical contact with the priest when the spell is cast.

No action he takes can affect the physical world, but he can pass through walls, doors, and other solid objects without hindrance.\n\nThe priest can choose to end the spell voluntarily at any time, materializing in the physical world in one round.

However, the spell offers no protection from causes of certain death—being crushed under a landslide, etc. Only a willing individual can be affected by a feign death spell. The priest is able to end the spell effect at any time, but it requires a full round for bodily functions to begin again.\n\nNote that, unlike the wizard version of this spell, only people can be affected, and that those of any level can be affected by the priest casting this spell.\n\nNotes: Common for clerics (PHB)."

        "Introduction": "A glyph of warding is a powerful inscription magically drawn to prevent unauthorized or hostile creatures from passing, entering, or opening. It can be used to guard a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or box.\n\nThe priest must set the conditions of the ward; typically any creature violating the warded area without speaking the name of the glyph is subject to the magic it stores. A successful saving throw vs. spell enables the creature to escape the effects of the glyph. Glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics, such as creature type, size, and weight. Glyphs can also be set with respect to good or evil, or to pass those of the caster's religion. They cannot be set according to class, Hit Dice, or level. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area; although if a cabinet had three drawers, each could be separately warded.\n\nWhen the spell is cast, the priest weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. For every 5 square feet of area to be protected, one round is required to trace the warding lines of the glyph. The caster can affect an area equal to a square the sides of which are the same as his level, in feet. The glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of the caster's total square footage. Thus, a 6th-level caster could place a glyph on a 6-foot x 6-foot square, a 4-foot x 9-foot rectangle, a 2-foot x 18-foot band, or a 1-foot by 36-foot strip. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become invisible.\n\nThe priest traces the glyph with incense, which, if the area exceeds 50 square feet, must be sprinkled with powdered diamond (at least 2,000 gp worth).\n\nTypical glyphs shock for 1d4 points of electrical damage per level of the spellcaster, explode for a like amount of fire damage, paralyze, blind, deafen, and so forth. The DM may allow any harmful priest spell effect to be used as a glyph, provided the caster is of sufficient level to cast the spell. Successful saving throws either reduce effects by one-half or negate them, according to the glyph employed. Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled by magic and foiled by high-level thieves using their find-and-remove-traps skill.\n\nThe DM may decide that the exact glyphs available to a priest depend on his religion, and he might make new glyphs available according to the magical research rules.\n\nNotes: Common for clerics (PHB)."

The hold lasts for two rounds per caster level. The caster decides how many animals can be affected, but the greater the number, the better chance each has to successfully save against the spell. Each animal gets a saving throw: If only one is the subject of the spell, it has a penalty of -4 on its roll; if two are subject, each receives a penalty of -2 on its roll; if three are subject, each receives a penalty of -1 on its roll; and if four are subject, each gets an unmodified saving throw.\n\nA maximum body weight of 400 pounds (100 pounds for nonmammals) per animal per caster level can be affected—for example, an 8th-level caster can affect up to four 3,200-pound mammals or a like number of 800-pound nonmammals, such as birds or reptiles.\n\nNotes: Common for druids (PHB)."

        "Introduction": "This spell is an improved version of slow poison, with a duration measured in days rather than hours. When cast upon a victim who has been poisoned by any means, hold poison arrests the venom and prevents it from doing any additional damage to the victim. (In most cases, the spell must be cast during the poison's onset time in order to be effective.) Damage that has already been inflicted is not restored, but as long as the hold poison is in effect, the victim can be cured or healed of damage caused by poison by any normal means.\n\nThis spell can be used to indefinitely postpone the onset of a poison if the caster chooses to continue to cast it on the poisoned character before the previous hold poison wears off. However, each time a new hold poison is used to stop the venom's advance for another few days, there is a 2% cumulative chance that the spell fails and the poison runs its course. Evil priests have been known to deliberately poison a person and then use this spell to grant the victim a stay of death for a few days. This can be an extremely effective threat if the victim doesn't have access to a neutralize poison spell.\n\nThe material component is the priest's holy symbol and a bud of garlic, crushed and smeared on the injury (or eaten if the poison was ingested).\n\nNotes: Uncommon spell (PO:SM)."

        "Introduction": "This cooperative spell requires at least two priests to cast the spell simultaneously. During the casting, the priests determine whether the line will be stationary or portable.\n\nIf the spell is stationary, each priest must inscribe a magical sigil on parallel facing surfaces, such as facing walls of a gatehouse or two tree trunks. If the spell is portable, the priests must stand at each end of the line, thereby anchoring it.\n\nAfter the spell is cast, a shimmering field of force appears between the two anchors (the sigils or priests). The field is 10 feet high and sparkles with energy. Objects on the opposite side of the translucent field, while recognizable, are hazy and indistinct.\n\nThe field causes 1d3 points of damage to all creatures passing through it; evil creatures and undead suffer 1d8 points of damage from the field.\n\nCreatures that roll a successful saving throw suffer no damage. Creatures that can fly over the field, burrow under it, or teleport to the other side are immune to damage.\n\nIf the spell is cast in its portable form, the priests can move at half their movement rates (limited to the rate of the slower priest). The priests can take no other action, since all their energy is spent in walking and maintaining the field.\n\nOnce created, the field cannot be increased or decreased in length and must remain straight. The priests could maneuver by pivoting, but could not walk toward each other or bend the field around a corner. If the line of sight between the two priests is blocked by any object of greater than 5' diameter, the spell immediately fails. Thus, creatures, low walls, young trees, pillars, and similar objects will not disrupt the spell.\n\nAs a cooperative spell, several priests can link together to create a longer field. Each priest (or sigil) forms the end of one field and the beginning of another, much like fenceposts. Each section of the spell must extend in a straight line, but the field can be bent at each junction. Four priests could form a long line, a square, or a Z pattern. The restrictions on moving the fields apply as outlined above. The DM may apply movement penalties depending on the complexity of the pattern.\n\nThe material components are the priests' croziers, staves, or religious standards, held aloft by each caster.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, line of destruction, causes 1d3 damage to all creatures passing through it. It causes 1d8 damage to paladins and creatures of good alignment who pass through it. Creatures that roll a successful saving throw suffer no damage.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for clerics and druids with access to the sphere of Protection."

Note that the area must have brush and trees in it in order for this spell to take effect. Briars, bushes, creepers, lianas, roots, saplings, thistles, thorn, trees, vines, and weeds become so thick and overgrown in the area of effect as to form a barrier. The area of effect is a square 20 feet on a side per level of experience of the caster, in any square or rectangular shape that the caster decides upon at the time of the spellcasting. Thus, an 8th-level caster can affect a maximum area of a 160-foot x 160-foot square, a 320-foot x 80-foot rectangle, a 640-foot x 40-foot rectangle, a 1,280-foot x 20-foot rectangle, etc. The spell's effects persist in the area until it is cleared by labor, fire, or such magical means as a dispel magic spell.\n\nThe second use of the spell affects a one-mile square area. The DM secretly makes a saving throw (based on the caster's level) to see if the spell takes effect.

The curse can have one of the following effects (roll percentile dice): 50% of the time it reduces one ability of the victim to 3 (the DM randomly determines which ability); 25% of the time it lowers the victim's attack and saving throw rolls by -4; 25% of the time it makes the victim 50% likely to drop whatever he is holding (or do nothing, in the case of creatures not using tools)—roll each round.\n\nIt is possible for a priest to devise his own curse, and it should be similar in power to those given here. Consult your DM. The subject of a bestow curse spell must be touched. If the victim is touched, a saving throw is still applicable; if it is successful, the effect is negated. The bestowed curse cannot be dispelled.\n\nNotes: Common for clerics and druids (PHB)."

        "Introduction": "Repair injury is intended for use in campaigns featuring the critical hit or critical strike rules. This spell addresses one specific injury or wound (see Chapter 8 ). It can be used to knit a broken bone, alleviate the swelling and pain of a sprain or a twist, or repair soft-tissue damage such as an injured eye, ear, or a severed tendon. If used as a simple curing spell, repair injury restores 1d10+1 hit points to the injured character, but if used to address the effects of a specific injury, repair injury automatically removes one grazed, struck, injured, or broken condition, and alleviates any combat, movement, or maximum hit point penalties associated with the injury in question. The spell does not restore any lost hit points to the victim, other than the 1d10+1 that are incidental to the working of the spell.\n\n''Beran, a fighter with 44 hit points, is struck by an ogre’s club. The blow inflicts 12 points of damage, but Beran also suffers a broken hip. This injury will reduce him to a maximum of 25% of his normal total, so Beran’s current hit points drop from 32 to 11 after the battle ends. In addition, he is not capable of moving or attacking due to the effects of the injury.''\n\n''When the smoke clears, Talmos the priest comes to Beran’s aid. Using repair injury, he knits Beran’s broken hip. The spell cures 6 hit points in the process. Beran no longer suffers the movement or attack penalties for a broken hip and has 17 hit points to his credit. With time or additional healing, he can regain his normal total of 44.''\n\nRepair injury is also helpful in dealing with wounds that fall in the crushed, shattered, or destroyed category. This spell reduces the severity of the injury to the broken level, which means it heals as if it were 20d6 lost hit points. Only one repair injury can be used on any given wound, so a character with a shattered knee could still require a lot of time to recover after an application of this spell.\n\nSevered limbs, destroyed eyes or ears, and ability score losses caused by injuries cannot be healed by this spell. Repair injury is the equivalent of cure serious wounds for the purpose of slowing or stopping bleeding.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for clerics, provided the optional system is used (PO:SM)."

One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle (note that the head of a worm or snake could be thus ensnared).\n\nIf a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The magic of the spell causes the tree to bend and then straighten when the loop is triggered, inflicting 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped, and lifting it off the ground by the trapped member(s) (or strangling it if the head/neck triggered the snare). If no such sapling or tree is available, the cordlike object tightens upon the member(s), then wraps around the entire creature, causing no damage, but tightly binding it. Under water, the cord coils back upon its anchor point.\n\nThe snare is magical, so for one hour it is breakable only by cloud giant or greater Strength (23); each hour thereafter, the snare material loses magic so as to become 1 point more breakable per hour—22 after two hours, 21 after three, 20 after four—until six full hours have elapsed. At that time, 18 Strength will break the bonds. After 12 hours have elapsed, the materials of the snare lose all magical properties and the loop opens, freeing anything it held. The snare can be cut with any magical weapon, or with any edged weapon wielded with at least a +2 attack bonus (from Strength, for example).\n\nThe caster must have a snake skin and a piece of sinew from a strong animal to weave into the cordlike object from which he will make the snare. Only the caster's holy symbol is otherwise needed.\n\nNotes: Common for druids (PHB)."

        "Introduction": "This spell summons a minor spirit or entity to the caster’s aid. Clerics usually summon minor elementals of some kind, while shamans typically conjure an animal spirit or spirit of nature. Regardless of the spirit’s origin, it appears as a ghostly beast of some kind—wolves, bears, tigers, or lions are most common. The animal spirit obeys the mental commands of the priest, attacking his enemies or performing any other task that it could reasonably accomplish. The creature is incorporeal and cannot handle or manipulate objects of any kind, but it can see and hear as a normal animal of its archetype and could be used to scout a dangerous area or act as a distraction of some kind.\n\nIn combat, the animal spirit has the following statistics: MV 24; AC 4; THAC0 15; Dmg 2d4. It can only be injured by magical weapons and can strike monsters hit only by +1 or better weapons. The spirit has a number of hit points equal to 10 plus the caster’s level, so a 6th-level priest conjures a animal spirit with 16 hit points. The creature is not affected by charm, sleep, hold, or other mind-affecting spells and suffers no damage from cold-based attacks. However, it is vulnerable to dispel magic or turning as an undead monster of the caster’s Hit Dice. If the animal spirit is turned, destroyed, or dispelled, the priest who summoned it must make a saving throw vs. spell or be stunned for 1d4 rounds.\n\nBecause the spirit is intelligent and free-willed under the caster’s direction, the priest need not concentrate in order to direct its attacks—an animal spirit could be ordered to attack a spellcaster in the back of an enemy party, while the cleric waded into hand-to-hand combat. The animal spirit makes use of flank or rear attacks when it can and gains any normal combat bonuses that a living creature in its position would be entitled to. The priest enjoys instantaneous, silent communication with the animal spirit and can order it to stop attacking, to change its target, or to undertake almost any conceivable action desired. However, the spirit must remain within the spell’s range; if it is ever more than 10 yards per caster level away from the priest, it dissipates harmlessly.\n\nThe material component is a small whistle carved from a bone taken from the appropriate type of animal.\n\nNotes: Common for shamans, uncommon for clerics (PO:SM)."

A cloud of the flying type, or a swarm of the crawling sort, appears after the spell is cast. This gathers at a point chosen by the caster, within the spell's range, and attacks any single creature the caster points to.\n\nThe attacked creature sustains 2 points of damage if it does nothing but attempt to flee or fend off the insects during the time it is attacked; it suffers 4 points of damage per round otherwise. If the insects are ignored, the victim fights with a -2 penalty to his attack roll and a +2 penalty to his Armor Class. If he attempts to cast a spell, an initiative roll should be made for the insects to see if their damage occurs before the spell is cast. If it does, the victim's concentration is ruined and the spell is lost.\n\nThe insects disperse and the spell ends if the victim enters thick smoke or hot flames. Besides being driven off by smoke or hot flames, the swarm might possibly be outrun, or evaded by plunging into a sufficient body of water. If evaded, the summoned insects can be sent against another opponent, but there will be at least a 1 round delay while they leave the former opponent and attack the new victim. Crawling insects can travel only about 10 feet per round (maximum speed over smooth ground) and flying insects travel 60 feet per round. The caster must concentrate to maintain the swarm; it dissipates if he moves or is disturbed.\n\nIt is possible, in underground situations, that the caster might summon 1d4 giant ants by means of the spell, but the possibility is only 30% unless giant ants are nearby.

The most powerful group, a choir, requires eleven or more priests. In this case, the area of effect expands to a cone 300 feet long and 100 feet wide at the base. All within the area of effect suffer 1d6 points of damage per priest to a maximum of 20d6. A saving throw vs. spells reduces the damage to half. Those who fail to save are deafened for 1d10 rounds; those who succeed are deafened only 1d6 rounds. Undead creatures of 5 hit dice or less are immediately destroyed. Undead with more hit dice are not allowed a saving throw. Structures within the area of effect are damaged as if they suffered a direct hit from a catapult (one hit per four priests in the choir). Doors, chests, and other breakable items are instantly shattered.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for priests with major access to the sphere of Combat (ToM)."

        "Introduction": "By anticipating possible futures and outcomes of the caster’s actions, this spell provides the character with a temporary sixth sense or feel for danger. The spell operates on a subconscious level, and the caster receives strong intuitive impulses when he contemplates courses of action that may bring immediate physical injury or harm to him. For example, if the priest was about to open a trapped chest, the unfailing premonition would create a flash of insight or a gut feeling telling him that he shouldn’t do so. Similarly, opening a door that leads into the lair of a ferocious troll may also trigger the spell’s warning. Threatening a NPC who is likely to respond by drawing a weapon and attacking the PC would create a warning, but threatening a NPC who will get even with the priest in an hour or two will not trigger the premonition.\n\nThe unfailing premonition is also quite useful in combat, as long as the priest obeys his instincts and ducks, dodges, or withdraws when his subconscious tells him to. While the spell is in effect, the priest gains a +2 bonus to his Armor Class and saving throws, but in any given round there is a 25% chance that he will have to forego his intended action in order to obey the spell’s warning impulses.\n\nThe premonition only works on actions undertaken by the priest himself. If his companion is about to pull a mysterious lever that will drop a 10-ton block of stone on the priest, he receives no warning.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with access to the sphere of Time (PO:SM)."

Note that if the information is not acted upon, the conditions probably change so that the information is no longer useful (in the example, the troll might move away and take the treasure with it).\n\nThe base chance for a correct divination is 60%, plus 1% for each experience level of the priest casting the spell. The DM makes adjustments to this base chance considering the actions being divined (if, for example, unusual precautions against the spell have been taken). If the dice roll is failed, the caster knows the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.\n\nThe material components of the divination spell are a sacrificial offering, incense, and the holy symbol of the priest.

        "Introduction": "This spell creates the necessary conditions for devotional energy to be used. For faith magic to work, the priest must create a focus to harness the necessary devotional energy. This spell creates that focus. A focus cannot function without a source of devotional energy.\n\nThe focus gathers devotional energy and reshapes it in order to amplify other spells cast by the priest (or priests). The same energy keeps the focus in existence. If the spell is cast and there is no immediate source of devotional energy within 100 feet, the focus immediately fails.\n\nOnce created, most foci cannot be moved. This condition and the need for a constant supply of devotional energy tends to limit the use of foci to temples, churches, monasteries, shrines, and seminaries—permanent structures where followers of the religion gather on a regular basis. Sometimes a focus is created for a special gathering such as a holy day, conclave, grand wedding, or yearly festival.\n\nNot all foci are identical. The particular form of the focus depends on the power and nature of the spell being amplified. All foci can be seen by detect magic. There are three basic types of foci: site, item, and living.\n\nSite foci are connected to a place, whether a room, building, field, or forest. Once cast, the foci cannot be moved. It causes no disturbance in the surroundings; it is invisible and intangible.\n\nItem foci are centered on a single object. Customarily, this object is large and immovable, such as an altar, but it is possible for the focus to be as small as is practical. The item can be as elaborate or plain as desired, but should have some significance to the religion.\n\nLiving foci are the rarest of all types. In this case, the focus is created on a living plant, animal, or person. Detect charm reveals the person is somehow enchanted, although not under the influence of a typical charm spell.\n\nThe type of focus created (site, item, or living) depends on the religion and nature of the spell amplified. These choices are listed in Table 3: Focused Spell Effects.\n\nCasting the focus spell is a long and complicated process, accompanied by many ceremonies and rituals. During the day spent casting the spell, the priest will need the assistance of at least two other priests of the same faith. These aides need not memorize the spell (or even be capable of casting it). Their duty is to provide the extra hands and voices needed at specific points of the casting. A large number of worshipers must also be present since the focus requires their energy. Not surprisingly, the casting of this spell is often incorporated into important holy festivals or special occasions.\n\nThe duration of the focus is one year. If the devotional energy falls below a minimum level, the spell ends sooner. A focus requires the devotional energy of at least 100 devout worshipers. Lay monks (those dedicated to the religion but not priests) count as two worshipers, while priests (of any level) count as ten. A focus could be maintained by a congregation of 100, a monastery of fifty, or a seminary of as few as 10 priests (or any combination of the above). The focus must receive this energy for at least 10 hours out of every day. If these conditions are not met, the focus weakens. The area of effect of the amplified spell decreases by 20% each day until it fades away completely.\n\nOnce the focus is created, the priest or priests have 1 turn in which to cast the desired spell upon the focus. A focus can amplify only one spell, and each item, creature, or place can receive only one focus. Spells that can be cast upon a focus are listed on Table 3.\n\n\n * * The caster states a desired range (temperature, wind strength, etc.) within the spell's normal limitations at the time it is cast.\n\nOnce the spell is cast, the normal duration and area of effect for that spell are ignored. The focus begins to increase these factors of the spell's power. After one day, the amplified spell reaches its full area of effect. Thereafter, it remains over that area until the focus fails.\n\nThe area affected by the focus (and its amplified spell) depends on the level of the caster. The spell expands in a radius from the focus, 20 feet per level of the caster, although it can deliberately be created smaller. Within that area of effect, the amplified spell exerts its normal effect. A 13th-level priest could create a focus up to 260 feet in diameter.\n\nThe material components are many, including special vestments, incense, oils, waters, and other equipment the DM deems appropriate. The cost of these materials is never less than 1,000 gp plus 100 gp per level of spell being amplified. These items are given up as offerings to the deity (perhaps to be distributed to the poor), and new ones must be obtained each time the spell is cast.\n\nNotes: Uncommon spell (ToM)."

        "Introduction": "By using this spell, the caster can place one willing subject in a state of suspended animation. The victim’s breathing, heartbeat, and other vital processes slow to the point of nonexistence, although he or she seems to be deeply asleep, not dead. A caster of 7th to 10th level can maintain the suspended animation for up to one week plus one day per level; a caster of 11th to 15th level can maintain the state for up to one month plus one week per level; and a caster of 16th level or higher can place someone in suspended animation for one year plus one month per level.\n\nThis spell has many useful applications. First, all bodily or mental afflictions become quiescent during the victim’s slumber. Poison, insanity, and many curses (lycanthropy, geas, and mummy rot included) can be arrested, if not cured, and have no effect on the subject while he sleeps. Of course, if the spell is broken prematurely, all the conditions that were halted by the spell will start once again. Second, the subject requires no food or water, but he still needs air and dies if deprived of oxygen. Third, for every month that the subject is in suspended animation, he recovers one hit point.\n\nThe caster can awaken the subject at any time within the spell’s duration, although he must be in the subject’s presence to do so. Optionally, the priest may pre-specify an amount of time within his normal duration or a special condition to awaken the sleeper. A condition must include a physical stimulus to the subject, such as a change in temperature, the touch of the sun, the kiss of a princess, or whatever the priest desires. If the priest maintaining the spell dies or is not able to awaken the sleeper, then the subject can be taken to another priest of the same deity to be awakened.\n\nIf the subject is attacked, he is completely helpless and can be killed by a single blow. However, if the subject is attacked without being slain for some reason, he gains a saving throw vs. spell each round to emerge from his suspended animation. The subject will be extremely groggy and disoriented if his slumber is disturbed in this fashion, suffering a –2 penalty to all die rolls for 1d6 turns, but if he awakens in the normal or prescribed fashion, he is disoriented for only one round.\n\nSome of the drawbacks to this spell affect the casting priest. First of all, it takes all of the priest’s concentration to cast and maintain this spell. This means that the priest cannot cast any other spell while a subject is being held under the influence of the suspended animation. For each week that the subject is in suspended animation, the priest loses one point of Constitution. This happens each week until the priest transfers the spell to another priest of the same alignment. Transferring this spell requires a successful saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is successful, then the priest who transfers the spell can start recovering Constitution at a rate of one point per hour of bedrest. If the saving throw doesn’t succeed, then the priest loses another point of Constitution and cannot try to transfer the spell again for 8 hours. Either way, because of the temporary lapse of the spell, the subject will automatically lose 1 hit point each time a transfer is attempted.\n\nThe material component for this spell is a rare herb that must be prepared with exacting care. The treatment costs at least 200 gold pieces and requires 1d3 days of the priest’s time and attention.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for clerics (PO:SM)."

This cooperative spell requires two priests who must spend the day casting this spell. During the casting, the priests must decide which additional spells (of all levels) are desired. Upon completion of the casting, the priests touch palms, and the priest of higher level receives a charge of magical energy. This charge temporarily boosts the level of the priest for spellcasting purposes. The amount of increase is one level per five levels of the lower level caster (fractions rounded up). If both priests are of equal level, the casters must decide who benefits from the spell.\n\nThe spell grants the priest the spellcasting ability of the new level. It does not improve hit points, attack rolls, or other abilities. If the increase allows more spells per level, the additional spells are instantly placed in the character's memory. A priest is also enabled to cast spells normally beyond his level. Range, duration, area of effect, and other variables are all based on the character's temporary level.\n\nThe increased effect lasts only 1 turn. At the end of the turn, all additional spells are lost and the character reverts to his normal level.\n\nAs an example, consider a party with a fallen comrade. The two priests in the party are 7th and 8th level, both unable to cast raise dead. After a night's rest, each priest adds uplift to his memorized spells. After casting the spell, the 8th-level priest suddenly gains the casting abilities of a 10th-level priest, including the ability to cast raise dead. At the end of one turn, the priest's abilities revert to 8th-level.\n\nCasting this spell is an arduous task, causing a severe drain on the priests. When the spell expires, the uplifted character suffers 2d6 points of damage from mental exhaustion. This damage cannot be healed by any means until the character has had at least eight hours of rest.\n\nThe material components are the priests' holy symbols and an offering worth at least 500 gp from each priest.\n\nNotes: Uncommon spell (ToM)."

This \"arcane message\" is normally straightforward and easy to understand, but in the case of highly complex circumstances, the message might be cryptic. In any case, the message will always be truthful.\n\nAs an example, consider a priest and his party who are on a holy quest to retrieve an item of power. On the way to the location of this item, the party is ambushed by evil creatures from the Inner Planes but manages to defeat them. Concerned that these creatures might be outlying guards protecting the item of interest, the priest casts consequence, hoping for guidance. The DM knows that these creatures have nothing to do with the quest; the encounter was coincidental. However, the surviving monsters will soon be returning with reinforcements to avenge their dead. Therefore, the DM tells the priest's player, \"To your goals these have no place, but still they can cause more woe.\"\n\nCasting this spell \"taints\" subsequent castings of the same spell within a 24-hour span. A second attempt within this period always results in the same message as the first, regardless of the true situation.

If the caster instead forces an extradimensional creature into the Prime Material Plane, one or more of the following effects may apply, at the DM's option:\n\n\n * The creature's Armor Class may be reduced by 1d6 points for the duration of the spell.\n * The quality of a magical weapon needed to strike the creature may be reduced by one “plus”; for example, a monster normally hit by +2 or better weapons may become vulnerable to +1 weapons for the spell's duration.\n * The creature may suffer permanent death upon the loss of all its hit points.\n * Use of 1d6 spell-like powers (such as gating in allies) may be limited or negated.\n * Undead creatures lose the ability to drain life energy levels.\n\nThis spell does not prevent extradimensional travel on the Prime Material Plane (i.e., dimension door, blinking, teleport, or similar effects), but it does prevent the subject from plane shifting or becoming ethereal while in effect.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with major access to the Sphere of Numbers, uncommon for clerics (PO.SM)."

        "Introduction": "This cooperative spell requires only one priest to cast it, but can be cast only on another priest of the same faith. The recipient of the spell must voluntarily surrender himself to the spell. The recipient becomes a host for the caster. While the recipient does not lose his own persona or ability to act, the host can be dominated by the caster at any time. For the most part, this domination is complete.\n\nFor the duration of the spell, the caster is essentially detached from his own body. He can neither move nor act on his own. His mind is connected to the host's. He sees, hears, smells, tastes, and otherwise senses everything the host does. He can telepathically communicate with the host. Once the spell is completed, there is no limit to the range over which it can function. However, both the caster and host must remain on the same plane. Since the spell relies on telepathic communication, thin lead sheeting will effectively block the connection.\n\nWhen desired, the caster can dominate the host. When this happens, the host's own mind is pushed to the background and the caster's personality dominates. The host's personality, memories, proficiencies, and spells are temporarily replaced by those of the caster. While occupying the host, the caster can cast any spell he himself has memorized, provided that the necessary components are on hand. These spells function exactly as if the priest had cast them from his own body.\n\nThe caster can return control to the host at any time, restoring the character's abilities and personality without harm.\n\nThe spell is not without limitations and risks. The domination must be voluntary. If the host resists the casting of the spell, it automatically fails. Once the spell is in effect, the host can attempt to resist the domination. He is then allowed a saving throw. If successful, the spell immediately ends.\n\nWhenever the host suffers damage, the caster must make a saving throw vs. death to maintain the spell. If the save is failed, a wave of pain is transmitted to the priest, causing 1d6 points of damage and canceling the spell. If the host should die, the caster must make a system shock roll with the risk of suffering instant death.\n\nThe material component is a chalice worth no less than 1,000 gp. This chalice must be given as a gift to the host (who cannot return it to the donor for any reason).\n\nNotes: Common for priests with major access to the sphere of Thought (ToM).\n\n\n * Errata: Change sphere to “All” from “Charm.”"

        "Introduction": "When a priest enters othertime, he steps into a different reality in which the world around him is frozen at a moment in the future. Until time catches up to him, he may move about unhindered and observe his surroundings; no force known can detect his presence or harm him in the alternate reality, although he in turn cannot affect any creature or object in the physical world. For instance, he could read a book at the page it was opened to, but he could not turn the page since that would require him to move an object that is temporarily immovable for him. To his companions or enemy in real time, the priest appears to simply vanish altogether, only to reappear at some later point.\n\nThe duration of this spell is a little odd, to say the least. The priest may choose a duration of up to 1 round at 7th to 9th level, 2 rounds at 10th to 12th level, 3 rounds at 13th to 16th, 4 rounds at 17th to 19th, up to a maximum of 5 rounds at 20th level or higher. The duration chosen by the priest governs the length of the othertime; if the priest decides that the spell will last 2 rounds, then he is instantly transported to that point in time, surrounded by the frozen still-life of the world as it will appear 2 rounds after the priest cast othertime. The caster then has 2 rounds to himself to take any actions he cares to, although he cannot affect the real world by any physical, magical, or mental means.\n\nWhile the caster is in the othertime, he is completely unaware of the intervening events. In the example above, if the caster’s friends were teleported away 1 round after the caster left and replaced by an identical group of dopplegangers, the caster would have no chance to detect the switch; all he sees are the bodies of his “friends,” frozen in the positions they will occupy when he emerges from the othertime. This also means that nasty things like dragon breath, cloudkills, or mind blasts that pass through the spot where the caster happens to be have no effect on him—he simply does not exist in the real world while he waits for everyone else to catch up to him.\n\nAs noted above, the caster gains an amount of subjective time equal to the duration of the spell. By leaping 3 rounds into the future, the caster gains 3 rounds of actions in the othertime. He could drink a potion, cast a spell, and then maneuver for an attack, for example, or he could gain a 3-round head start by running for his life while no one else can pursue him. If the priest uses this time to study a battle and position himself for an attack, he gains a –4 bonus to his initiative roll on the round he emerges from othertime, and a +4 attack bonus with his first strike.\n\nLeaping in and out of the time stream is a dangerous activity; every time the priest employs this spell, there is a 1% noncumulative chance that he becomes stuck in othertime, doomed to death by thirst or starvation when his own rations run out. Only the most extraordinary measures (a wish spell, divine intervention, etc.) can save a character in this predicament. Once a priest is in othertime, he cannot pray for further spells. After all, if the priest is going to attract his deity’s attention by praying for spells, the deity will most likely allow him out!\n\nThe material component for this spell is an hourglass filled with rare salts, worth at least 100 gold pieces.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with major access to the sphere of Time."

The numbers after the slashes are the cost and time requirements for destinations about which little is known in the home campaign. All prices are in gold pieces.\n * 3 The number is the typical cost in gold pieces for constructing one rod, provided that the proper materials are available. Rods made of extremely rare materials can cost considerably more.\n * 4 Add these modifiers to the type of plane the Pocket Dimension is attached to. For example, researching a Pocket Dimension that is attached to the Ethereal Plane costs 2,500 gp and takes 5 weeks. The cost for the rod remains 100 gp."

Otherwise, it attempts to slay its summoner and return from whence it came.\n\nThe object or creature to be brought must be such as to allow the aerial servant to physically bring it to the priest (an aerial servant can carry at least 1,000 pounds). If prevented, for any reason, from completing the assigned duty, the aerial servant returns to its own plane whenever the spell lapses, its duty is fulfilled, it is dispelled, the priest releases it, or the priest is slain. The spell lasts for a maximum of one day for each level of experience of the priest who cast it.\n\nIf the creature to be fetched cannot detect invisible objects, the aerial servant attacks, automatically gaining surprise. If the creature involved can detect invisible objects, it still suffers a -2 penalty to all surprise rolls caused by the aerial servant. Each round of combat, the aerial servant must roll to attack. When a hit is scored, the aerial servant has grabbed the item or creature it was sent for.\n\nA creature with a Strength rating is allowed an evasion roll, equal to twice its bend bars chance, to escape the hold. If the creature in question does not have a Strength rating, roll 1d8 for each Hit Die the aerial servant and the creature grabbed have. The higher total is the stronger.\n\nOnce seized, the creature cannot free itself by Strength or Dexterity and is flown to the priest forthwith.\n\nNotes: Common spell for clerics (PHB)."

If the priest's level indicates that a creature would be aged beyond this level, the creature is aged to one year short of his maximum age. The spell cannot cause a subject to die.\n\nHuman and humanoid characters affected by the spell experience changes in appearance associated with increased age, such as gray hair and wrinkles. More significantly, they suffer losses in Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution when they reach certain age levels. These are summarized in Table 12: Aging Effects in the Player's Handbook. The Player's Handbook also provides rules for determining a character's base age.\n\nNonmagical monsters can be affected by age creature. The DM determines a monster's current age and natural life span based on its description in the MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM or based on his own judgment. To determine the effects of aging on a monster, assume the following: a monster is middle-aged when it reaches half its natural life span; a monster reaches old age at two-thirds of its natural life span; a monster reaches venerable age in the last one-sixth of its years. A monster suffers the penalties which follow when it reaches these age levels. The penalties are cumulative and permanent (unless the affected monster becomes younger).\n\nThe material component is a pinch of powdered emerald.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, restore youth, permanently restores age that has been lost as a result of magic (such as an age creature spell). Restore youth reduces the age of the targeted creature by one year per level of the caster. The subject must make a successful system shock roll to survive the change. Subjects who become younger regain the lost ability scores described above.

The animated object, or objects, then attacks whomever or whatever the priest first designates. The animated object can be of any nonmagical material whatsoever[md]wood, metal, stone, fabric, leather, ceramic, glass, etc. Attempting to animate an object in someone's possession grants that person a saving throw to prevent the spell's effect.\n\nThe speed of movement of the object depends on its means of propulsion and its weight. A large wooden table would be rather heavy, but its legs would give it speed. A rug could only slither along. A jar would roll. Thus a large stone pedestal would rock forward at 10 feet per round, a stone statue would move at 40 feet per round, a wooden statue 80 feet per round, an ivory stool of light weight would move at 120 feet per round. Slithering movement is about 10 feet to 20 feet per round; rolling is 30 feet to 60 feet per round.\n\nThe damage caused by the attack of an animated object depends on its form and composition. Light, supple objects can only obscure vision, obstruct movement, bind, trip, smother, etc. Light, hard objects can fall upon or otherwise strike for 1d2 points of damage or possibly obstruct and trip, as do light, supple objects. Hard, medium-weight objects can crush or strike for 2d4 points of damage, while larger and heavier objects may inflict 3d4, 4d4, or even 5d4 points of damage.\n\nThe frequency of attack of animated objects depends on their method of locomotion, appendages, and method of attack. This varies from as seldom as once every five melee rounds to as frequently as once per round. The Armor Class of the object per round. The Armor Class of the object animated is basically a function of material and movement ability. Damage depends on the type of weapon is effective against fabric, leather, wood, and like substances. Heavy smashing and crushing weapons are useful against wood, stone, and metal objects. Your DM will determine all of these factors, as well as how much damage the animated object can sustain before being destroyed.\n\nThe priest can animate one cubic foot of material for each experience level he has attained. Thus, a 14th-level priest could animate one or more objects whose solid volume did not exceed 14 cubic feet - a large statue, two rugs, three chairs, or a dozen average crocks.\n\nNotes: Common for clerics (PHB)."

Other creatures gain a saving throw vs. spell to resist command monster, but only if they have an Intelligence of Exceptional (15) or better, or the creature's levels or Hit Dice are equal to or greater than the caster's.\n\nJust like the 1st-level spell command, this spell coerces the subject into obeying the priest's one-word order to the best of its ability. The order must be absolutely clear and unequivocal; the subject will continue to obey for one round per two caster levels—six rounds at 12th level, seven at 14th, and so on. If this action places the subject in mortal peril, he may attempt a saving throw (whether he was originally entitled to one or not) in order to break free of the spell's power. Therefore, ordering a character standing at the edge of a cliff to “jump” will create an opportunity for the subject to break free.

All creatures and items in the area of effect stand motionless, rivers stop running, and arrows hang suspended in the air. Any creature, person, or object entering the area of effect is likewise frozen in time. The caster is affected if he is within the area of effect, unless he is the subject of the spell.\n\nAn unwilling subject is allowed a saving throw vs. spell; if successful, the spell is immediately negated. Otherwise, the victim is forced to relive all the actions taken in the previous 1-4 rounds in reverse. Beginning with the most recent round, the subject moves backward, arrows fired by the subject return to his bow, and so on. All effects of these actions are negated. At the end of the spell's duration, normal time resumes and all creatures immediately continue their activities, picking up right where they had stopped.\n\nConsider the following example. A party is battling a spellcasting red dragon. In the first round, the dragon breathes fire, roasting the party's wizard. The rest of the group attacks and injures the dragon. On the second round, the dragon bites and kills the group's thief. More damage is caused to the beast, but it is still alive in the third round, when it uses magic missile to kill the ranger. At this point, the priest casts reverse time on the beast. Fortunately, it fails its saving throw and is forced to reverse the last four rounds. While everyone else freezes, the dragon goes into reverse. The magic missiles zoom back to the dragon (and it regains the ability to cast that spell), it \"unbites\" the thief (removing that damage from the character), and then inhales its fiery breath (leaving the roasted wizard alive and uncooked). The dragon is then reversed through one more round—the round before it encounterd the party. The spell then ends and actions resume.\n\nThe dragon must now roll for surprise since it is encountering the party for the first time. The party is immune to surprise, since it was fighting the beast previously. All damage suffered by the dragon remains, since these actions were caused by the group and not the beast.\n\nThe material component is an etched silver arrow bent into a circle. The arrow must be no more than 3 inches long and worth no less than 500 gp. The arrow is destroyed in the casting.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with major access to the sphere of Time (ToM)."

        "Introduction": "This powerful cooperative spell is rarely invoked since it requires the concerted effort of six or more high-level priests. The casting effort severely weakens the priests, discouraging casual use of this spell.\n\nTo cast the spell, six or more priests must be within a 15-foot radius. Each priest must cast spiritual wrath at the same time. Before beginning the spell, the priests must decide upon the area of effect. The spell causes 10d6+1d6 points of damage per priest casting the spell. (The minimum damage, therefore, is 16d6.) Creatures within the area of effect are allowed a saving throw vs. spell to reduce the damage to half.\n\nThe spell strikes as a great wave of force that descends from the sky. Small objects must save vs. crushing blow. Structures suffer damage as if hit by a heavy catapult (2d12). The force of this spell often raises a great cloud of dirt and dust, obscuring the area for 1d4+1 rounds.\n\nThe spell's area of effect is determined by the number of casters. Each priest contributes 10 feet to the radius of the spell. Six casters would create a spell with a radius of 60 feet. No more than twelve casters can cooperate to cast this spell (maximum of 22d6 damage and a 120-foot radius area of effect). This converts to an 8-inch circle in the BATTLESYSTEM™ rules ground scale.\n\nThe spell is difficult to cast, physically taxing the spellcasters so much that each caster suffers 3d10 points of damage from the effort. There is no saving throw allowed to avoid this damage.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for priests with major access to the sphere of Combat (ToM)."

A dragon's age cannot be reduced below hatchling or increased beyond great wyrm.\n\nUnwilling dragons are allowed a saving throw vs. spells with a -4 penalty to avoid the effect.\n\nA dragon affected by age dragon temporarily acquires the armor class, hit points, spell abilities, combat modifiers, size, and other attributes of his new age level. The dragon retains his memories and personality. At the end of the spell's duration, the dragon returns to his normal age level.\n\nIf the dragon suffered damage while experiencing his modified age, these hit points remain lost when he resumes his normal age. If the dragon loses more hit points at his modified age than he has at his actual age, he dies when the spell expires. For example, a young adult bronze dragon with 110 hit points is aged to a mature adult with 120 hit points. The dragon suffers 115 hit points in combat. Unless the dragon is healed of 6 points of damage before the spell expires, the dragon dies at the end of the spell since his damage is greater than his actual hit points.\n\nIf a dragon is killed while under the effect of age dragon, he is dead at the end of the spell's duration.\n\nThe material component is a handful of dirt taken from a dragon's footprint.\n\nNotes: Common for to priests with major access to the sphere of Time (ToM)."

        "Introduction": "By means of this spell, a priest is able to project his astral body into the Astral plane, leaving his physical body and material possessions behind on the Prime Material plane. As the Astral plane touches upon the first levels of all the outer planes, the priest can travel astrally to the first level of any of these outer planes as he wills. The priest then leaves the Astral plane, forming a body on the plane of existence he has chosen to enter. It is also possible to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material plane by means of the astral spell. However, a second body cannot be formed on the Prime Material plane.\n\nAs a general rule, a person astrally projected can be seen only by creatures on the Astral plane. The astral body is connected at all times to the material body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed, astrally and materially, but generally only the psychic wind can cause the cord to break. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to the caster's body where the body rests on the Prime Material plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.\n\nThe spell lasts until the priest desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic spell or destruction of the priest's body on the Prime Material plane—which kills the priest. The priest can project the astral forms of up to seven other creatures with himself by means of the astral spell, providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the priest. These fellow travelers are dependent upon the priest and can be stranded if something happens to the priest. Travel in the Astral plane can be slow or fast, according to the priest's desire. The ultimate destination arrived at is subject to the desire of the priest.\n\nNotes: Common for clerics (PHB)."

The priest need not touch or even see the diseased people for the spell to be effective, although recipients must be within the area of effect.\n\nThis spell does not cure all diseases in the community at one time; the caster must specifically state which disease is to be eliminated (black plague or yellow fever, for example) with each casting of the spell.\n\nWhen the spell is cast, the priest exhales a sweet-smelling breath. This forms into a breeze that radiates outward, forming a circle that expands in a 50-yard radius per hour. During this time, the caster must remain at the center of the area of effect. For example, after 12 hours, the breath of life would cover a circle 1200 yards in diameter (600-yard radius). The breath is of a magical nature rather than a physical nature; therefore, it is unaffected by prevailing winds.\n\nThe breeze blows through the community, instantly eliminating the specified disease from all afflicted citizens. The breath of life spell does not destroy parasitic monsters (such as green slime, rot grubs, and others), nor does it cure lycanthropy or other magical afflictions. The spell does not prevent recurrence of a disease if the recipients are again exposed.\n\nThe material components are the priest's holy symbol and a cone of incense that has been blessed by the highest priest of the character's religion.\n\nThe breath of death, which produces a foul-smelling wind, is the reverse of this spell. Victims who fail a saving throw vs. death magic are afflicted with a nonmagical, fatal disease. To determine the results of this spell, the DM should roll saving throws for major NPCs in the area of effect. The effect on the rest of the community can be calculated as a percentage, based on the saving throw.\n\nInfected creatures do not heal hit points until the disease is cured. The disease is fatal within 1d6 weeks (the duration varies from person to person).\n\n\n * Priest's Spell Compendium Addendum: Can be cured with the breath of life spell. The casting of this version of the spell is an evil act.\n\nThe material components are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of dust taken from a mummy's corpse.\n\nNotes: Uncommon spell (ToM)."

Those successfully saving are unaffected by the spell. Confused creatures react as follows (roll 1d10):\n\nThe spell lasts one round for each level of the caster. Those who fail their saving throws are checked by the DM for actions each round, for the duration of the spell, or until the “wander away for the duration of the spell” result occurs.\n\nWandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible in their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). This is not panicked flight. Wandering creatures also have a 50% chance of using any special innate movement abilities (plane shift, burrowing, flight, etc.). Saving throws and actions are checked at the beginning of each round. Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a set of three nut shells.\n\nNote: If there are many creatures involved, the DM may decide to assume average results. For example, if there are 16 orcs affected and 25% could be expected to successfully roll the saving throw, then four are assumed to have succeeded, one wanders away, four attack the nearest creature, six stand confused and the last acts normally but must check next round. Since the orcs are not near the party, the DM decides that two who are supposed to attack the nearest creature attack each other, one attacks an orc that saved, and one attacks a confused orc, which strikes back. The next round, the base is 11 orcs, since four originally saved and one wandered off. Another one wanders off, five stands confused, four attack, and one acts normally.\n\nNotes: Common for clerics (PHB)."

A creature of an alignment opposed to the priest (e.g., evil if the priest is good, chaotic if the priest is lawful) cannot be ordered around unless it is willing. Note that an absolute (true) neutral creature is effectively opposed to both good and evil, and both law and chaos.\n\nThe spellcaster must know something about the creature to exact service from it, or else he must offer some fair trade in return for the service. That is, if the priest is aware that the creature has received some favor from someone of the priest's alignment, then the exaction spell can name this as cause. If no balancing reason for service is known, then some valuable gift or service must be pledged in return for the exaction. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the past or promised favor or reward, and with the being's effort and risk. The spell then acts, subject to a magic resistance roll, as a quest upon the being that is to perform the required service. Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to the vicinity of the priest, and the priest must then and there return the promised reward, whether it is irrevocable cancellation of a past debt or the giving of some service or other material reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.\n\nThe DM adjudicates when an equitable arrangement has been reached. If the caster requests too much, the creature is free to depart or to attack the priest (as if the agreement were breached) according to its nature. If circumstances leave the situation unbalanced (for example, the creature dies while achieving a result that was not worth dying for), then this might create a debt owed by the caster to the creature's surviving kith and kin, making the caster vulnerable to a future exaction spell from that quarter. Agreeing to a future exaction or release in the event of catastrophic failure or death are common caster pledges in securing an exaction.\n\nFailure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in the priest being subject to exaction by the subject creature or by its master, liege, etc., at the very least. At worst, the creature can attack the reneging priest without fear of any of his spells affecting it, for the priest's failure to live up to the bargain gives the creature immunity from the priest's spell powers.\n\nThe material components of this spell are the priest's holy symbol, some matter or substance from the plane of the creature from whom an exaction is expected, and knowledge of the creature's nature or actions that is written out on a parchment that is burned to seal the pledge.\n\nNotes: Common for clerics (PHB).",

Note that a true (absolute) neutral priest is greatly opposed to all other alignments, for the purposes of this spell. A creature which can be affected receives no saving throw, nor will magic resistance protect it. However, this spell does not affect deities or divine beings.\n\nIf the creature has received a great favor in the past from a person of the priest's alignment, the priest can name this as a reason for service. This requires that the priest know the personal history of the creature. If no past service is known to the priest, he or she must pledge a valuable gift or favor to the creature in return for its service. In all cases, the reward promised by the priest must be equivalent to the service required from the creature. The spell then forces the creature to perform the service agreed upon. If the creature fails to perform the mission, it will suffer the penalties of the spells geas and quest simultaneously, until the mission is completed. Creatures cannot be compelled to obey self-destructive or suicidal commands.\n\nWhen the service demanded from the creature is performed, it is instantly teleported to the priest's location. The priest must then perform the service or grant the reward agreed upon. When the creature's reward is granted, it is immediately sent back to its own plane.\n\nIf the priest reneges on the agreement, the creature has two options to choose from. Each is a part of the original spell and does not require magical ability or spellcasting from the creature. Should the agreement be broken, the creature can place the priest under exaction. The priest receives no saving throw against this effect. Otherwise, the creature can attack the priest. Should it choose to do this, it will be totally unaffected by any spells cast by the priest.\n\nThe material components of this spell are: the priest's holy (or unholy) symbol, matter from the home plane of the creature from whom an exaction is required, and knowledge of the creature's nature or past actions written on a page of parchment which is burned to seal the bargain."

        "Introduction": "* This spell replaced the Mindkiller spell on the 2nd Printing of Tome of Magic onward.\n\nThe mind tracker is a magically-created creature which exists only on the Ethereal plane. It is called into existence when the first portion of this spell is cast.\n\nWhen seen (which is seldom), the mind tracker has an indistinct body. It seems to be a near-solid coalescence of the vaporous atmosphere of the Ethereal plane itself. It is a roughly elliptical body with three or more limbs protruding at seemingly random locations. The number and size of these appendages shifts slowly, however, as new ones appear from the mist and old ones disappear. The body of the creature averages 2 feet across and 3 feet long, though this, too, tends to vary from minute to minute. The mind tracker has no discernible eyes, ears, nose, or other organs. It cannot be engaged in combat; if attacked, it simply disappears, to reappear after the danger has passed, or somewhere else entirely if its quarry has moved on.\n\nThe ceremony which creates the mind tracker takes one turn to perform. Its material components are a whiff of the Ethereal plane's atmosphere and the brain of a lizard.\n\nOnce the tracker is manifested, it must be assigned a quarry within one hour. If no quarry is designated, the tracker dissipates and the spell is wasted.\n\nTo assign a quarry to the tracker, the priest must have the quarry within his sight. This includes magical sight such as true seeing, but not remote sighting devices such as crystal balls. With the quarry in sight, the priest mouths the final phrases of the spell. From that point on, the mind tracker is mentally tethered to the victim. It follows its quarry (staying always in the Ethereal plane) wherever it goes. It constantly relays information about the subject to the priest: what it is doing, where it is. The priest does not actually see an image of the quarry, he receives `reports' from the mind tracker. These reports contain only such information as the tracker can gather by looking. It cannot identify people the quarry is talking to, but can describe them in great detail. Nor can it hear anything the quarry or anyone else says, or read writing, but it recognizes and can report the fact that speaking or reading is happening.\n\nWhile the tracker is dogging its quarry, its presence can be felt as an eery, creepy sensation of being watched. If the victim makes an initial save vs. paralyzation, each of the following stages lasts three hours instead of two. For the first two hours, the quarry has a general feeling of ill ease. In the third and fourth hours, the victim is distracted and nervous, and suffers a -1 penalty on all saving throws. In the fifth and sixth hours, the victim is convinced someone or something is following him and suffers a -3 penalty on saving throws and a -2 (or -10%) penalty on all other dice rolls. After six hours the victim is near his breaking point. He is unable to concentrate to cast spells or use any of his class's special abilities. All die rolls have a -5 (or -25%) penalty. After eight hours, he must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation. If he fails, he collapses, fevered and delirious.\n\nThis state persists until the tracker ceases to exist.\n\nThe mind tracker continues to exist for as long as the priest remains conscious of its input. If the priest is knocked out or falls asleep, or simply dismisses his creation, the tracker dissipates."

This reverses any previous life energy level drain of the creature by a force or monster. Thus, if a 10th-level character had been struck by a wight and drained to 9th level, the restoration spell would bring the character up to exactly the number of experience points necessary to restore him to 10th level once again, restoring additional Hit Dice (or hit points) and level functions accordingly. Restoration is effective only if the spell is cast within one day of the recipient's loss of life energy, per experience level of the priest casting it. A restoration spell restores the intelligence of a creature affected by a feeblemind spell. It also negates all forms of insanity. Casting this spell ages both the caster and the recipient by two years.\n\nThe reverse, energy drain, draws away one life energy level (see such undead as spectre, wight, and vampire, in the Monstrous Manual). The energy drain requires the victim to be touched. Casting this form of the spell does not age the caster.\n\nNotes: Common for clerics (PHB)."

The creature can have been dead up to 10 years per level of the priest casting the spell. Thus, a 19th-level priest can resurrect the bones of a creature dead up to 190 years. The creature, upon surviving a resurrection survival check, is immediately restored to full hit points and can perform strenuous activity. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has reached its allotted life span (i.e., died of natural causes). Casting this spell makes it impossible for the priest to cast further spells or engage in combat until he has had one day of bed rest for each experience level or Hit Die of the creature brought back to life. The caster ages three years upon casting this spell.\n\nThe reverse, destruction, causes the victim of the spell to be instantly dead and turned to dust. A wish spell or equivalent is required for recovery. Destruction requires a touch, either in combat or otherwise, and does not age the caster. In addition, the victim is allowed a saving throw (with a -4 penalty). If the save is successful, the victim receives 8d6 points of damage instead.\n\nThe material components of the spell are the priest's religious symbol and holy water (unholy water for the reverse spell). The DM may reduce the chances of successful resurrection if little of the creature's remains are available.\n\nNotes: Common for clerics (PHB)."

      "sections": {
        "Introduction": "This cooperative spell is rarely used or spoken of, since its requirements are strict and the outcome is uncertain. The spell must be cast by six priests of the same faith. All six must touch hands at the time of casting. At the completion of the spell, the priests fall into a trance. The life essences of the priests leave their bodies and merge at a point within 10 feet of the casters. The spirits of the priests meld together to form the avatar of the priests' deity.\n\nIn this manner, the six characters become a single being with all the powers and abilities allowed to that avatar. The only stipulation is that the priests' deity cannot have created all avatars allowed to it at that moment. If this has happened, the spell fails and the priests are drained as described below.\n\nIf the spell succeeds, the priests have completely given their wills over to their deity, essentially forming the vessel into which it funnels power. In becoming the avatar, the priests retain the ability to make most of their own decisions. (The six must work in harmony or allow one of their number to decide all actions.) However, the deity can assume direct control of the avatar at any time it desires—the avatar is, after all, an earthly manifestation of the deity.\n\nAlthough the spell has a duration of one hour, the deity is not obliged to release the priests at that time. If the priests are not released at the end of the spell's duration, they instantly die. A deity can choose to sacrifice its priests in order to maintain its avatar on the Prime Material plane. Such a cruel and unjust action is almost never undertaken by good deities or those that have any respect for life, free will, or mercy. For dark and sinister gods, the question is much more uncertain. If a deity chooses to maintain the avatar longer than one hour, control of the avatar instantly and permanently passes to the DM. (Clearly, a DM should seldom if ever exercise this power.)\n\nWhile the priests are formed into the avatar, their bodies remain in a death like trance. The priests have no idea what might be happening to their real bodies (unless the avatar can observe them). Any damage to a priest's body requires an instant system shock roll. If successful, the damage is recorded normally, but the damage does not take effect until the spell ends (at which point the priest will almost certainly die). If the system shock roll is failed, the character instantly dies and the spell ends. Characters who die in this manner cannot be raised, resurrected, or reincarnated. They have been taken to the ultimate reward (or punishment) for the service they have rendered. If the bodies are moved from their positions, the spell ends.\n\nEven if the deity releases the priests, they are left severely drained. All spells memorized are lost until the priest can rest and perform his prayers once again. The physical drain leaves each priest with only 1 hit point upon awakening, regardless of the number of hit points the character had when the spell was cast. Since damage suffered during the spell takes effect instantly, any priest who is hurt dies immediately (although quick action by others might save him).\n\nEach priest who survives the spell will be bound by a quest (a duty that must be completed in exchange for calling upon their god).\n\nThe material component is an offering appropriate to the deity. The DM determines the exact nature of this offering.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for priests with major access to the sphere of Summoning (ToM)."

        "Introduction": "By casting this spell, the priest creates a powerful magic aura in some specially prepared object—a string of prayer beads, a small clay tablet, an ivory baton, etc. This object radiates magic, for it contains the power to instantaneously transport its possessor to the sanctuary of the priest who created its magic. Once the item is enchanted, the priest must give it willingly to an individual, at the same time informing him of a command word to be spoken when the item is to be used. To make use of the item, the recipient must speak the command word at the same time that he rends or breaks the item. When this is done, the individual and all that he is wearing and carrying (up to the maximum encumbrance limit for the character) are instantly transported to the sanctuary of the priest, just as if the individual were capable of speaking a word of recall spell. No other creatures can be affected.\n\nThe reversed application of the spell causes the priest to be transported to the immediate vicinity of the possessor of the item when it is broken and the command word said. The priest has a general idea of the location and situation of the item's possessor, and can choose not to be affected by this summons. This decision is made at the instant when the transportation is to take place. However, if he chooses not to go, the opportunity is gone forever and the spell is wasted.\n\nThe cost of preparing the special item (for either version of the spell) varies from 2,000 to 5,000 gp. The more costly items can transport the subject from one plane of existence to another, if the DM allows. Note that the same factors that can prevent the operation of the plane shift and teleport spells can also prevent the use of this spell.\n\nNotes: Common for clerics (PHB)."

        "Introduction": "The most humble of priestly spells is the orison, a brief prayer or invocation of a minor nature. Typically, priests learn a number of orisons as acolytes or students in order to hone their spellcasting skills and emphasize concepts, ideals, or phrases of particular importance to the faith. Because an orisons is not even on par with other 1st-level magic, a priest memorizes a number of individual orisons equal to three +1 per level (up to a maximum of nine) when he devotes a 1st-level spell slot to orison. In other words, a 1st-level priest can memorize four orisons for one 1st-level spell slot, a 2nd-level priest can memorize five, and so on.\n\nUnlike cantrip, an orison must have a specific effect, although the priest need not decide which incantation he will use until he actually casts the spell. Regardless of the prayer chosen, the orison’s duration is never more than one round per level. Known orisons include the following:\n\n\n * Alleviate: A single creature suffering from nausea or pain is relieved of its discomfort. Magically induced nausea or pain is only alleviated if the victim passes a saving throw vs. spell with a –2 penalty.\n * Calm: A single creature that has been startled or frightened is soothed. Victims suffering from magical fear may attempt a save vs. spell with a –2 penalty to calm themselves.\n * Clarity: For the duration of the orison, the priest’s speech is clear and free of impediment—useful for readings from sacred texts and other such rites. Magical conditions such as confuse languages cannot be overcome by this orison.\n * Courage: The priest gains a +1 bonus to his next attack roll, as long as the attack is made within the spell’s duration.\n * Guidance: The priest gains a +1 bonus to a Wisdom or Intelligence check to determine the right course of action in a moral dilemma or puzzle.\n * Healing: By his touch, the priest may heal a creature of 1 point of damage.\n * Magic sense: If there is a persistent spell effect or magical item within 10 yards, the priest feels a recognizable tingle or sensation of some kind. He has no way to determine what item or spell may have caused the reaction.\n * Memory: Any item the priest commits to memory during the spell duration is more completely and permanently learned; he gains a +2 bonus to any checks to recall the exact appearance, wording, or meaning of an item, text, or message.\n * Resistance to magic: The caster gains a +1 bonus to his next saving throw against magic of any type, as long as it occurs during the orison’s duration.\n * Resistance to poison: The priest gains a +1 bonus to his next saving throw vs. poison, as long as it occurs during the orison’s duration.\n\nOther orisons of similar power or scope may be permitted by the DM. Generally, an orison should not affect more than one creature or die roll at a time, and an orison that can actually cause immediate harm to a creature should inflict no more than 1 or 2 points of damage. An offensive orison would be quite rare and most probably associated with an evil or chaotic priesthood.\n\nNotes: Uncommon spell for clerics and druids (PO:SM)"

Note that on a roll of 1, battlefate does not help the character ththe priest intends to aid—such is the nature of chaos.\n\nThe material component for this spell is an electrum coin tossed by the priest as he casts the spell.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with access to the sphere of Chaos."

        "Introduction": "By means of this spell, the priest can accurately estimate the chance of success of one specific action, such as climbing a dangerous cliff, making a trick bowshot, crossing a burning room unharmed, or even striking an enemy. The action in question must be one that would normally be resolved by a die roll, but the priest doesn't have to be the person who attempts the feat; he can use calculate to estimate the odds for anyone taking an action in his sight. The priest has a 70% chance, +2% per level, of making an accurate estimate.\n\nIf successful, the DM reveals to the player the action's chance for success or any modifiers that may be in play. For example, he could reveal a particular opponent's Armor Class or THAC0, the saving throw an opponent would require in order to save against a particular spell cast by the priest or the priest's wizard companion, or a character's chance to open doors, bend bars, or use a thief ability. The priest could even calculate his odds for actions that might be resolved by a die roll or DM caprice, such as his chance to avoid detection by hiding behind a rock. This spell takes into account factors that the priest himself may not be aware of, so from time to time a character may receive some very confusing results from this spell. For instance, if the priest doesn't know that an orc chieftain is actually a polymorphed tanar'ri masquerading as an orc, he may be astonished to learn that the “orc” has a THAC0 of 7!\n\nIf the priest fails his calculation check with a roll of 99 or 00, his calculation is wildly skewed in a random fashion.\n\nThe material component for this spell is a miniature abacus of ivory worth at least 100 gp. It is not consumed in the casting of the spell.\n\nNotes: Common for a priest with access to the sphere of Numbers (PO.SM)."

The firelight is resistant to gusts of wind or poor burning conditions (pouring rain, lack of air, and so on), but complete immersion in water, vacuum, or magical darkness extinguishes the flame immediately. Firelight burns brighter and steadier than a normal flame, and a torch enchanted with this spell sheds light in a 30-foot radius instead of the normal 15-foot radius. The fuel source lasts throughout the duration of the spell. Unlike log of everburning, this spell is not at all useful for staying warm since firelight produces very little heat.\n\nFirelight inflicts 1d2 points of damage per caster level if cast on creatures of living or elemental fire, but has no other effect on these monsters.\n\nThe material component is a mix of resins and incense, thrown into the flame to be affected.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for druids (PO:SM)."

Undead creatures and monsters vulnerable to bright light sustain 1d6 points of damage, plus 2 points per caster level. In addition to sustaining damage, living victims are also blinded for 1d4 rounds by the spell.\n\nThe sun must be in the sky when sunscorch is cast, or the spell fails entirely. It cannot be cast underground, indoors, or in hours of darkness, although routine overcasts do not hinder the sunscorch.\n\nNotes: Common for priests of the Sun sphere of the Dark Sun setting."

        "Introduction": "A priest with access to this spell need not fear most routine falls, since the casting of the wind column creates a pillar of strong winds to slow his descent. The spell is most effective in areas or regions where a strong breeze is available, such as the heights of a mountain or the mast of a ship at sea. In areas of dead, calm air, it is much more difficult to muster the windpower necessary to arrest the caster's fall. The caster's rate of descent (and risk of damage) varies with the strength of the prevailing winds, as shown below.\n\nIf the wind is very strong, the caster can even choose to gain altitude instead of falling, although he can rise no higher than 5 feet per level above his original height before the wind column loses cohesiveness and he starts to fall again. However, a priest could use this to leap out a castle window and allow the winds to bear him to the roof of the tower, if the conditions are right.\n\n\n * 1 Maximum of 8 points\n * 2 Maximum of 10d2 points\n * 3 Maximum of 12d3 points\n\nIf you prefer to use the combat round scale from Player's Option: Combat & Tactics, rounds are approximately one-tenth as long, and movement per round is reduced accordingly. For example, in moderate winds, the caster will fall about 48 feet per round in the Combat & Tactics scale.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for druids (PO:SM)."

        "Introduction": "This spell temporarily calms a chaotic situation involving a group of people. The situation may involve any range of emotions from violence (as in a barroom brawl) to joy and merrymaking (as in a festival or carnival).\n\nUnlike the emotion spell, calm chaos does not cause a change in the emotions of affected creatures—anger, fear, or intense joy remain in each individual. The emotion is simply restrained rather than released. Thus, an angry character intent on attacking someone will still feel the desire to do so, but he will withhold his action as long as the spell remains in effect.\n\nCreatures to be affected are allowed a saving throw vs. spell at a -4 penalty to avoid the effects. If more creatures are present than can be affected, creatures nearest the caster are affected first.\n\nAfter casting the spell, the priest makes a Charisma check. If successful, all characters affected by the spell are compelled to stop what they are doing. They are filled with the sensation that something important is about to occur. At this time, the priest or a character of his choosing must gain the attention of the affected creatures by giving a speech, performing for the crowd, or casting spells with intriguing visual effects (such as dancing lights). The attention of the crowd is then held for as long as the distraction continues. A character could filibuster and maintain control over the affected characters for hours or days.\n\nTwo conditions will cause the group to resume its original actions. In the first, the method of entertaining the crowd ceases for one round—the speech ends or the spell expires. If this action is not replaced with another distraction within one round, the crowd is freed of the spell.\n\nIn the second condition, if an event occurs that is more immediate than the distraction, the crowd will divert its attention to that event. Thus, if the spell were used to stop a barroom brawl and the building caught fire or was attacked, the crowd's attention would be diverted and the individuals could act freely.\n\nCreatures whose attention is held by the spell cannot be instructed to attack or perform any action. Such creatures will ignore suggestions of this nature. Depending on the nature of the request, the DM may deem that the suggestion causes a distraction that ends the spell.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with access to the sphere of Law (ToM)."

The spell affects 10 pounds of food per level of the caster. Anyone who eats the affected food (even a character who eats the salad but not the stew) is subject to the effects of the spell.\n\nThe effects of the spell begin five rounds after the food has been eaten. At that time, creatures who have eaten the affected food are allowed a saving throw; success indicates that a creature is not affected.\n\nAffected creatures quickly become agitated. Petty events ranging from poor table manners to loud talking bother everyone. After five minutes, tempers flare, characters feel compelled to shout at and insult one another, and threats are hurled. Even normally calm characters will feel compelled to vent their frustrations violently.\n\nCreatures maintain no alliances while under the effect of dissension's feast.

This effect can be completely removed by the 6th level priest spell heal or by normal rest.\n\nNote also that materials such as wood, leather, or flammable cloth smolder and burn if exposed to searing hot metal.

This causes the loss of all feeling in a hand (or hands, if the DM rules the saving throw was failed badly) for 1d4 days. During this time, the character's grip is extremely weak and he cannot use that hand for fighting or any other activity requiring a firm grasp.\n\nThe chill metal spell is countered by a resist cold spell, or by any great heat—proximity to a blazing fire (not a mere torch), a magical flaming sword, a wall of fire spell, etc. Under water, this version of the spell inflicts no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, exerting an upward buoyancy.\n\nNotes: Common for druids (PHB)."

        "Introduction": "Theoretically, every action has a particular moment at which it will have its greatest possible effect. Using the arcane mathematics of this spell, the priest can determine the \"ideal moment\" for any single action in each round that the spell is in effect. This action must be performed by a character other than the priest.\n\nIn practice, another character informs the priest of an action he wants to undertake in a round. The priest concentrates on the action, then informs the character when the \"correct moment\" has come. The character then gains a bonus of 20% (+4 on a d20) to the success of his action. The spell can affect only a single action in a given round. When used in combat, the priest can advise the best moment to initiate an action (affecting initiative) or what moment offers the greatest success in striking (affecting the chance to hit).\n\nIf the character seeks advice concerning initiative, he gains a -2 modifier to the initiative roll, but only at the cost of -2 on his chance to hit. Characters who seek the best attack frequently delay their actions. These characters suffer a +1 on their initiative roll but gain a +4 on their chance to hit. The spell cannot affect the amount of damage caused, since the act (striking) has already succeeded at that point.\n\nCharacters are not obliged to wait for the moment specified by the priest. For example, a fighter might decide that striking first is more important than gaining +4 to hit. The character can act normally, based on his or her unmodified initiative. The character gains no bonus from the moment spell, and the priest can affect no other action in that round.\n\nNoncombat actions can also benefit from the moment spell. For example, a thief planning to climb a wall may wait to start her climb until the priest informs her that the moment is right. If she waits, she gains a bonus of 20% to her Climb Walls roll (in this case, the bonus is subtracted from her roll).\n\nWhile concentrating on this spell, the priest can take no other action. A break in the priest's concentration—taking damage in combat, for example—terminates the spell instantly.\n\nThe material component is a set of three silver dice, which the priest tosses in his hand while concentrating on the spell. The dice are not consumed in the casting.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with access to the sphere of Numbers (ToM)."

The pseudopod can stretch up to 10 feet plus 1 foot per caster level from its source, so a 3rd-level priest could command watery fist to strike at a creature hovering thirteen feet above a lake or standing on the shore 13 feet from the water. The pseudopod obeys the priest’s mental commands, although the priest must concentrate each round in order to maintain control of the watery member.\n\nThe pseudopod is incapable of fine manipulation, but it can be used to make bludgeoning or constricting attacks. When used to strike at opponents, it attacks with the caster’s THAC0 and inflicts damage as shown below. The priest may add his magical attack adjustment (from his Wisdom score) to his THAC0, but Strength-based adjustments or special weapon skills don’t help the priest to control watery fist. The pseudopod may be able to make rear or flank attacks if the priest can direct it into the proper position.\n\nIf used to encircle and constrict, the pseudopod must first make an attack roll as described above, inflicting damage based on the priest’s level. However, in following rounds, the pseudopod automatically strikes its grappled target for constricting damage, +1 point per round of constricting. In other words, in the first round the victim sustains listed damage, in the second round he sustains listed damage +1, in the third he sustains listed damage +2, and so on. The pseudopod holds its target with an effective Strength equal to the priest’s Wisdom score.\n\nWatery fist can be released by the priest any time he cares to stop concentrating on maintaining it. The pseudopod immediately resumes its normal state, possibly drenching a grappled creature or extinguishing a small fire if the caster wishes. The pseudopod is AC 6 and has 15 hp plus 1 hp per caster level, but it can only be damaged by magical weapons, fire, or cold; all other attacks simply pass through the water. Transmute water to dust, part water, lower water, and Otiluke’s freezing sphere all destroy watery fist on contact.\n\nThe material component is a vial full of blessed water or a sprig of mistletoe that is thrown onto the body of water from which the fist will be summoned.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for clerics and druids (PO:SM)."

        "Priest's Spell Compendium Text": "This spell plants a section of ground with magically created spikes that damage units moving though the affected area.\n\nThe spell can create two kinds of caltrops: infantry and cavalry. The first are of small size and are designed to harm foot soldiers. The latter are larger and cause serious damage to cavalry or units composed of size L or larger creatures. Cavalry caltrops are so large that size M or smaller creatures can easily step around them. This prevents damage to infantry units.\n\nEach time a unit moves into a planted area, the unit suffers an attack of AD=4 (for infantry caltrops) or AD=6 (for cavalry caltrops). Units charging through a planted area suffer double damage. A unit ending its move in a caltrop-sown region suffers another attack when it moves out of the area.\n\nThis spell creates a rectangular field of infantry caltrops up to 1600 square yards in area (for example, 40 yards x 40 yards, 20 yards x 80 yards, and so on), or a field of cavalry caltrops up to 900 square yards (for example, 30 yards x 30 yards, 20 yards x 45 yards, and so on).\n\nCaltrops make no distinction between friend and foe; all creatures entering a caltrop-sown area suffer the same consequences.

The caster indicates the desired area for the campsite (an area of 50-foot radius or less) and the number of persons the campsite is to accommodate (a number of persons equal to three times the level of the caster).\n\nThe servants clear the area of debris, set up tents and bedrolls, start a campfire, fetch water, and prepare a bland meal. The campsite is so skillfully prepared that it blends with the surrounding terrain, reducing the chance that the camp could be noticed by 50%. Campfires, loud noises, and other activities can negate this.\n\nThe entire process takes 4-16 (4d4) rounds to complete.\n\nThe servants make camp with the gear and equipment provided for them; otherwise, the servants will improvise with materials available in the immediate area (50 yards of the designated campsite). For instance, if the party has no tents or beds, the servants will construct crude but comfortable beds of weeds and grass and temporary shelters of leaves and branches. If no materials are available, such as in the desert or similarly barren terrain, the servants will do their best to make the party as comfortable as possible within the environmental limitations.\n\nThe servants cannot fight for the party, deliver messages, or take any other actions other than creating the campsite.\n\nThe material components are a piece of string, a bit of wood, and a drop of water.\n\nThe reverse, break camp, causes the invisible servants to strike a campsite (an area of 50-foot radius or less). The servants extinguish fires, dispose of debris, and pack gear for a number of people equal to three times the level of the caster. The entire process takes 4-16 (4d4) rounds to complete. When completed, all traces of the campsite are eliminated. The material components are the same as those for create campsite.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with access to the sphere of Travelers (ToM)."

The hand displays an outstretched palm, indicating that no such character or creature could be found. The hand then disappears.\n\nIf the hand locates the indicated subject, the hand beckons the subject to follow it. If the subject follows, the hand points in the direction of the caster, leading the subject in the most direct, feasible route. The hand hovers 10 feet in front of the subject, moving before him. Once the hand leads the subject to the caster, it disappears.\n\nThe subject is not compelled to follow the hand or help the caster. If the subject chooses not to follow the hand, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en route to the caster, the hand disappears; the subject will have to rely on his own devices to locate the caster.\n\nIf there is more than one subject within a 5-mile radius that meets the caster's description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand will not seek out a second subject.\n\nThe helping hand has no physical form. The hand can be seen only by the caster and potential targets. It cannot engage in combat or execute any other task aside from locating the subject and leading him back to the caster. The hand will not pass through solid objects, but can pass through small cracks and slits.\n\nThe material component is a black silk glove.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with access to the sphere of Travelers."

The potency of this spell can be increased if several priests cast it at the same time. The duration of the spell is then equal to one turn per level of the most powerful priest, plus one turn for every contributing priest. Each priest also increases the area of effect by one 10'x 10' square (these areas must be contiguous).

To cast the spell, the priest generates a series of random numbers and then studies the pattern contained in that string of numbers. This pattern contains information about current conditions.\n\nIn game terms, when this spell is cast, the DM communicates to the priest's player a single word or short phrase (no more than five words) describing the \"tone\" of the situation. Examples of suitable \"tones\" are \"imminent danger\" (the DM knows a dragon is approaching the area); \"peace and tranquility\" (the woods in which the PCS camp may look threatening, but the area is actually free of evil influence); or \"betrayal\" (one of the PCS' hirelings is actually a spy of their enemy). The DM can make this comment cryptic, but it should always be accurate and contain some useful information.\n\nThis spell has no specified area of effect. The result of moment reading will always concern the priest and anyone else in his immediate vicinity, but the definition of \"vicinity\" will vary depending on the circumstances. For example, the tenor of the moment might be \"severe danger\" if the priest is entering the territory of a dragon who attacks interlopers on sight.\n\nThe tenor of the moment is always personally applicable to the priest. For example, even if the priest is in a nation dangerously close to war with its neighbor, this condition will not appear in the tenor of the moment unless the priest is personally involved (if he's currently in the direct path of an invading army, for instance).\n\nOne casting of this spell tends to \"taint\" subsequent castings of the same spell unless they are separated by a minimum length of time. If a priest casts this spell twice within 12 hours, the second reading gives the same result as the first, regardless of the actual situation. If a second priest casts the spell within 12 hours of another priest's use of the spell, he receives an accurate reading.\n\nThe material component is a set of 36 small disks made of polished bone engraved with runes that represent numbers. These disks are not consumed in the casting.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with access to the sphere of Numbers (ToM)."

        "Introduction": "A pyrotechnics spell draws on an existing fire source to produce either of two effects, at the option of the caster.\n\nFirst, it can produce a flashing and fiery burst of glowing, colored aerial fireworks that lasts one round. Creatures in, under, or within 120 feet of the area that have an unobstructed line of sight to the effect are blinded for 1d4+1 rounds unless they roll successful saving throws vs. spell. The fireworks fill a volume 10 times greater than the original fire source.\n\nSecond, it can cause a thick, writhing stream of smoke to arise from the source and form a choking cloud that lasts for one round per experience level of the caster. This covers a roughly hemispherical volume from the ground or floor up (or conforming to the shape of a confined area) that totally obscures vision beyond 2 feet. The smoke fills a volume 100 times that of the fire source.\n\nThe spell uses one fire source within the area of effect, which is immediately extinguished. If an extremely large fire is used as the source, it is only partially extinguished by the casting. Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature (such as a fire elemental) used as a source suffers 1d4 points of damage, plus 1 point of damage per caster level. This spell does not function under water."

When the weapon is used, it hits and causes damage normally, but the damage is not applied to the creature struck by the weapon. Instead, the person wielding the weapon or one of his companions suffers the damage. If the weapon misses its target on any round, no damage is caused in that round.\n\nUsing a die roll, the DM randomly determines the victim of the damage. The DM selects a die with a value nearest the number of eligible creatures (the wielder of the weapon and his companions). If the number of creatures does not equate to highest value of a die, the wielder of the enchanted weapon takes the extra chances to be hit. For example, if a goblin wields a sword affected by this spell, he and his six companions are eligible to receive the damage. The DM rolls 1d8. On a roll of 1-6, one of the goblin's companions suffers the damage; on a roll of 7 or 8, the goblin with the affected weapon suffers the damage.\n\nThe weapon is affected for 3 rounds+1 round/level of the spell caster. If the wielder of the weapon changes weapons while the spell is in effect, the discarded weapon remains enchanted.\n\nThe material component is a bronze die.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with access to the sphere of Chaos (ToM)."

The creature's mind simply cannot decide on another course of action—it becomes frozen into a single thought and cannot change even if new circumstances would suggest otherwise. Thus, a warrior fighting a kobold will ignore the arrival of a beholder, and a thief picking a lock will pay no heed to the arrival of three guards.\n\nThe affected creature does not mechanically repeat the action; he is not an automaton. He will not continue to fire his bow at a dragon if he runs out of arrows but will choose another means of attacking the dragon to the exclusion of all other activities.\n\nA spellcaster in the process of casting a spell when rigid thinking takes effect will not attempt to repeat the spell (unless the spell has been memorized more than once). The spellcaster will, however, devote his attention to the target of that spell until his goal is met (e.g., if the caster were attacking a creature, he would continue to direct attacks at that creature; if the caster were trying to open a door, he would continue to work on the door until it opens).\n\nThe spell expires when the creature accomplishes his goal (i.e., the kobold is killed, or the lock is opened) or when the duration of the spell has ended.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with access to the sphere of Law (ToM)."

Thus, a warrior with 16 Strength (a +1 bonus to damage) who benefits from this spell with a keystone who has Strength 18/07 (a damage bonus of +3) gains a total bonus of +3 to damage (not +4 to damage).

The result is that the priest may cast another spell that affects the subject individual at a range much greater than normal. In other words, by gaining deep knowledge of the individual, the priest creates a \"channel\" to that individual that makes a subsequent spell easier to cast on that subject.\n\nOnly certain spells can benefit from telethaumaturgy:\n * bless*\n * command\n * charm person or mammal\n * detect charm\n * hold person\n * know alignment\n * remove curse*\n * probability control\n * quest\n * confusion (one creature only)\n * exaction\n\nFor spells marked with an asterisk (*), telethaumaturgy also increases the range of the reversed spell. Unless indicated, telethaumaturgy does not increase the range of the reversed spells.\n\nThe increase in range depends on the level of the priest casting telethaumaturgy:\n\nThus, a 12th-level priest who has cast telethaumaturgy on an individual could subsequently cast charm person on that individual at a range of 320 yards, rather than the normal range of 80 yards.\n\nA spell to be enhanced by telethaumaturgy must be cast on the round immediately following the completion of telethaumaturgy. Spells that normally affect more than one individual (such as confusion ) will affect only the selected subject when cast following telethaumaturgy.\n\nWhen telethaumaturgy is cast by a priest of 11th level or higher, it has an additional effect. If the target is within the normal range of the subsequent spell (e.g., 80 yards for charm person), the subject's saving throw suffers a penalty of -2.\n\nLike the personal reading spell, telethaumaturgy functions only if the priest knows the correct name of his subject. If the priest casts the spell using an alias, he will not know that telethaumaturgy has not taken effect until the subsequent spell fails. The priest does not automatically know why the subsequent spell failed (the subject might simply have made a successful saving throw).\n\nThe material component is a small book of numerological formulae and notes. This book is different from the book used in personal reading. The book is not consumed in the casting.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with access to the sphere of Numbers (ToM)."

Generally, the priest is limited to one discrete action per round since he must focus his wind servant tightly on any given task. The wind servant can affect objects or creatures weighing up to 1 pound per caster level, twice as much if the object is reasonably light or airy (a cloak, scroll, or haystack, for instance), or 10 times as much if the object is designed to be carried by the wind, such as a ship’s sail or a bird in flight.\n\nIf an object is within the spell’s weight limit, the caster may direct the wind servant to carry it along in gusts and air currents at a flying movement rate of 12 (E). If the object leaves the limits of the spell’s range, the wind servant fails, and the object drops or falls normally from that point. Flying creatures of size M or smaller can be forced to land or be driven away by use of the spell if they fall within the weight limit, or slowed by 50% if they exceed the weight limit. Employing the wind servant against an arrow or light missile adds a penalty of –4 to the attack roll.\n\nIn dusty, snowy, or sandy regions, the caster can instead use wind servant to create a vicious zephyr of stinging dust around an enemy. This zephyr inflicts damage equal to the opponent’s base AC less 2d6 points and creates a –2 penalty to the victim’s attack rolls. For example, an enemy in leather armor +1 (AC 7) would suffer 7 – 2d6 damage if attacked by means of this spell. Note that any use of the wind servant requires the priest’s undivided attention; he can take no other actions while directing the spell."

        "Introduction": "The philosophy of the Sphere of Numbers holds that the structure of reality—the \"equation of the moment\"—can be analyzed and modified by someone with sufficient knowledge and power. The addition spell allows a priest to add a new mathematical term to the equation of the moment. This effectively allows a new object or even a living creature to be brought into existence temporarily.\n\nThe effect of this spell varies depending on the level of the caster. At 10th level or lower, addition can create a single, inanimate object weighing up to 10 pounds. The spell gives the priest only rudimentary control over the creation process, so the object cannot be complex. The object must be described in a single word or short phrase (e.g., \"a water pitcher\" or \"a block of stone\"). The caster has no control over elements such as shape or color; thus, the water pitcher might be short, squat, and blue, or tall, slender, and red.\n\nObjects created with this spell cannot be of any greater mechanical complexity or technological level than a crossbow. If the priest tries to create an object that breaks this prohibition, the spell fails and nothing is created. Thus, if the priest tried to create \"a pistol,\" assuming he had heard the word somewhere, the spell would fail.\n\nObjects cannot contain any information in an abstract form such as writing or diagrams. If the priest tries to create an object that breaks this prohibition, there are two possible results: the spell may fail, or the object may be created without the information. Thus, if the priest were to attempt to create \"a spellbook,\" the result would be either a book similar to a spellbook with blank pages, or nothing at all.\n\nThe object appears at whatever location the caster wills, as long as it is within spell range. The object cannot appear in the same space occupied by another object or creature, or within a hollow object (for example, the priest cannot create an object blocking the trachea of an enemy).\n\nThe object created by addition remains in existence for 1 turn per level of the caster. During this time, it obeys all the laws of physics as if it were a \"real\" object. The object cannot be disbelieved and spells such as true seeing cannot distinguish it from a naturally-occurring object.\n\nPriests of 11th to 15th level can create a single inanimate object of up to 20 pounds in mass or two identical objects, each of up to five pounds in mass. The object(s) so created remains in existence for two hours (12 turns) per level of the caster.\n\nPriests of 16th to 19th level can create a single inanimate object of up to 50 pounds in mass or up to 10 identical objects, each of up to five pounds in mass. The object(s) is permanent unless destroyed. Since these objects are not magical constructs, but real additions to the \"equation of the moment,\" dispel magic has no effect on them. Alternatively, the caster can create a single normal (nonmonstrous) living creature of up to 20 pounds in weight. The creature, once created, behaves as a normal member of its species; the caster has no control over its actions. This creature remains in existence for 5 rounds per level of the caster.\n\nPriests of 20th level and above can create a single inanimate object of up to 100 pounds in mass or up to 10 identical objects, each of up to 10 pounds in mass. The object(s) are permanent. Alternatively, the caster can create a single normal (nonmonstrous) living creature of up to 100 pounds in weight and up to 2 hit dice. The creature, once created, behaves as a normal member of its species; the caster has no control over its actions. This creature remains in existence for 2 turns per level of the caster.\n\nThe material component is a small table of numerological formulae inscribed on an ivory plaque, plus a length of silken cord. During the casting, the priest ties the cord into a complex knot. As the magical energy is discharged, the cord vanishes in a flash of light. The plaque is not consumed in the casting.\n\nNotes: Common spell for priests with major access to the sphere of Numbers (ToM)."

For example, a caster first tries to summon wild dogs to no avail, then unsuccessfully tries to call hawks, and finally calls wild horses that may or may not be within summoning range. The DM must determine the chance of a summoned animal type being within the range of the spell. The animals summoned aid the caster by whatever means they possess, staying until a fight is over, a specific mission is finished, the caster is safe, he sends them away, etc. Only normal or giant animals can be summoned; fantastic animals or monsters cannot be summoned by this spell (no chimerae, dragons, gorgons, manticores, etc.).\n\nNotes: Common for clerics and druids (PHB)."

In the 12-hour period that follows the check, there is an equal chance that the character will be unable to sleep or unable to remain awake (roll 1d6; on a roll of 1-3, the character is awake, on a roll of 4-6, he sleeps). This condition lasts until the next sunrise (or sunset) when the check is made again.\n\nFor example, a fighter fails to save against chaotic sleep. For the next few hours, the spell has no effect. At sundown, the first check is made, resulting in a 2. The fighter does not notice anything until he tries to sleep that night, at which time he is wide awake, fidgeting and restless. At sunrise, another die roll is made, resulting in a 6. The fighter is suddenly exhausted and sleeps until sunset.\n\nCharacters who sleep as a result of this spell can be roused only by physical stimuli—a slap or a wound, for example. Once awake, the character remains conscious only as long as there are active stimuli around him, such as a fight. Walking through caves or riding a horse will not keep the character awake. Unlike a sleep spell, characters affected by chaotic sleep doze off as soon as they are left relatively undisturbed. Keeping an affected character awake is difficult at best.\n\nLack of sleep will eventually take a physical toll on any character under the influence of the spell. For every 12-hour period that a character remains awake beyond the first, he suffers a -1 penalty to THAC0. Such characters do not regain hit points as a result of normal healing. Spellcasters cannot memorize spells until they have had sufficient sleep.\n\nChaotic sleep can be removed with a remove curse.\n\nThe material components are a pinch of sand and three coffee beans.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with major access to the sphere of Chaos (ToM)."

The spell can be used to ensure the comfort of the caster and those with him in extreme weather conditions. The party could stand about in shirt sleeves during the worst blizzard (although it would be raining on them) or make ice for their drinks during a scorching heat wave.\n\nThe spell also provides protection from intense normal and magical attacks. If the extreme of temperature is beyond what could be affected by the spell (a searing blast of a fireball or the icy chill of a white dragon), the spell reduces the damage caused by 5 points for every level of the caster. Normal saving throws are still allowed, and the reduction is taken after the saving throw is made or failed. Once struck by such an attack, the spell immediately collapses.\n\nThe material component for this spell is a strip of willow bark (to lower temperatures) or raspberry leaves (to raise temperatures).\n\nNotes: Common for druids (PHB)."

The affected creatures must be involved in a single battle so that their efforts harmonize to the benefit of all involved. For example, the affected creatures can attack one dragon or a group of orcs in a single area. They can also attack additional enemy forces that arrive in the same combat. If the enemy forces divide and flee, the affected creatures can follow, continue to attack, and benefit from the spell. If the affected group is split into two smaller groups when attacked, however, it gains no benefit from defensive harmony.\n\nWhile the spell is in effect, each affected creature gains a +1 bonus to armor class for every other creature benefitting from the spell, to a maximum bonus of +5 (although more than five characters may be affected by the spell). Thus, if four creatures are affected by defensive harmony, each creature gains a +3 bonus to armor class.\n\nThis bonus represents a mystical coordination of effort on the part of all affected creatures. A fighter will naturally wage his attack to distract the troll attacking the thief. The ranger will instinctively block the swing of an orc, thereby protecting the wizard. Creatures affected by the spell are not consciously aware of these efforts, and they are unable to create specific strategies and tactics.\n\nNotes: Common for to priests with major access to the sphere of Law (ToM)."

      "sections": {
        "Introduction": "This spell allows the caster to selectively warp the fabric of space, folding it into higher dimensions.\n\nThis effect can be best explained through an example. If an ant crawling along the west edge of a map decided to travel to the east edge of the map, it would have to crawl the full width of the map. But if the map were folded in two so that the east and west edges were touching, the ant would travel almost no distance at all. The ant's world (the map) would have been folded through the third dimension. The dimensional folding spell does something similar with the three-dimensional world: it folds it through a higher dimension (the fourth), allowing instantaneous travel between two locales on the same plane of existence.\n\nAlthough this effect may seem similar to the wizard spell teleport, in practice, it is much different. The dimensional folding spell opens a gate that allows instantaneous, bidirectional access to a distant locale on the same plane. This gate is circular, of any size up to 10' in diameter, and remains in existence for up to 1 full round. The caster and any other creatures can pass through the gate in either direction while it remains open. Missile weapons and magic spells can also pass through the gate.\n\nThe gate appears as a shimmering ring, glowing with a faint light equivalent to starshine. Vision through the gate is clear and unobstructed in both directions, allowing the priest to \"look before he leaps.\" However, anyone on the other side of the gate is able to see the priest and his point of origin.\n\nThe \"near side\" of the gate always appears within 5 feet of the priest. The location of the \"far side\" of the gate always opens within 5 feet of the place the priest desires. Thus, there is no chance of arriving at the wrong destination, as with the wizard spell teleport.\n\nThere is a risk involved in using dimensional folding, however. Many philosophers believe that what we know as time is simply another dimension, and the behavior of this spell seems to support this thesis. Unless the priest is extremely familiar with the destination, there is a significant chance that any creature passing through a dimensional folding gate will suffer instantaneous aging. Theorists believe that this is the same kind of \"slippage\" that can cause a teleporting wizard to land high or low, except that in this case, the slippage is in the time dimension.\n\nThe chance of this instantaneous aging occurring depends on how familiar the priest is with the destination. The table that follows outlines the conditions and effects of aging.\n\n\n * * Use this row if the desired location is within view of the priest.\n\nIf the die roll indicates that aging occurs, every creature that passes through the gate in either direction suffers the aging effect. Multiple creatures passing through the gate in the same direction all age by the same amount determined by a single die roll. Although the chance of aging is low and the potential amount of aging is minimal for familiar destinations, the effects can add up and become significant over time.\n\nAlthough the word \"destination\" is used to refer to the \"far end\" of the gate, the priest need not be the one doing the traveling. For example, a priest may open the gate near a distant ally so he may travel instantaneously to join the priest.\n\nThe material component is a sheet of platinum \"tissue\" worth at least 15 gp, which the priest folds intricately during the casting. The tissue is consumed when the gate closes.\n\nNotes: Common for to priests with major access to the sphere of Numbers; common (ToM)."

Like fortify, entrench may be used to prepare an open outdoors area such as a field or grassland, or a rough outdoors area such as a hillside or forest. Large rooms or chambers may be entrenched as well. In addition to the ditches and ramparts of the fortify spell, entrench makes use of local materials to create a small palisade and an array of stakes or sharp stones to discourage attackers.\n\nA. Open Outdoors Site: A rampart or dike of earth faced by a staked ditch rises from the ground along the perimeter of the site. Creatures defending the dike receive 75% cover against missile fire (+7 bonus to AC), or 25% cover (+2 bonus) if they expose themselves by engaging in melee combat or firing missiles out of the dike. Attackers cannot charge, run, or sprint over the rampart, and must spend one full round negotiating the defenses in order to attack. The dike’s defenders receive a +1 bonus to attack rolls against any creatures trying to move through the stakes or stones.\n\nB. Rough Outdoors Site: Loose stones, deadwood, and briars are arranged to form a defensible wall along the perimeter of the area of effect, faced by an array of sharp stakes or stones. Characters hiding behind the wall receive 90% cover (+10 bonus to AC), or 50% cover (+4 bonus) if they expose themselves by firing missiles or defending the wall. Attacking creatures cannot run, charge, or sprint through the defenses, and must spend one full round to get through the stakes plus an additional round climbing over the wall in order to enter the fortified area. The wall’s defenders gain a +1 bonus to attacks against creatures negotiating the defenses.\n\nC. Marshy or Low-lying Site: In swamps or bogs, entrench creates a water-filled ditch around the perimeter of the area of effect. This ditch is 15 feet wide and 3 to 6 feet deep; most creatures require two full rounds to negotiate the ditch and climb up the far side, and defenders gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against enemies who are wading the ditch or climbing up the other side.\n\nThe fortifications created by this spell are permanent, although erosion, weathering, and clearing or filling can return the site to its original state. The material component is the shell of a giant nautilus. In the Battlesystem rules, entrench provides the defending units with a +3 bonus to their AR versus missile and melee attacks, but only a +1 bonus against missile attacks in marshy areas.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with major access to the sphere of War."

This change was used in \"Priest's Spell Compendium\"\n\nBy means of this spell, the priest can turn one or more normal-sized insects into larger forms resembling the giant insects described in the Monstrous Manual. Only one type of insect can be altered at one time (i.e., a single casting cannot affect both an ant and a fly) and all insects affected must be grown to the same size. The number of insects and the size to which they can be grown depends upon the priest's level:\n\nFor example, an 8th-level priest can grow three insects to 3 Hit Dice, four insects to 2 Hit Dice, or nine insects to 1 Hit Die. Flying insects of 3 Hit Dice or more can carry a rider of human size (assume that such can carry 80 pounds per Hit Die).\n\nIf the casting is interrupted for any reason, or if the insects are currently subject to any other magical effect (including this one), the insects die and the spell is ruined. The DM decides how many normal insects of what type are available; this is often a greater limitation on the spell than the limits above.\n\nIf the insect created by this spell matches an existing monster description, use the monster description. Otherwise, unless the DM creates a special description, the giant form has an Armor Class of between 8 and 4, one attack, and inflicts 1d4 points of damage per Hit Die.\n\nFor example, a 14th-level priest uses the giant insect spell to enlarge one beetle (all that is available) to 6 HD size. The DM decides the beetle has AC 5 and bites once for 6d4 points of damage.\n\nNote that the spell works only on actual insects. Arachnids, crustaceans, and other types of small creatures are not affected. Any giant insects created by this spell do not attempt to harm the priest, but the priest's control of such creatures is limited to simple commands (“attack,” “defend,” “guard,” and so forth). Orders to attack a certain creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too complex. Unless commanded to do otherwise, the giant insects attempt to attack whoever or whatever is near them.\n\nThe reverse of the spell, shrink insect, reduces any giant insect to normal insect size. The number of Hit Dice affected by the priest is subtracted from the number of Hit Dice of the insects, and any insect reduced to 0 Hit Dice has been shrunk. Partial shrinking is ignored; an insect is either shrunk or unaffected. Thus, a 9th-level priest attacked by giant ants could shrink three warrior ants or four worker ants to normal insect size with no saving throw. This spell has no effect on intelligent insectlike creatures.\n\nThe material component for both versions of the spell is the priest's holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Common for druids (PHB)."

        "Introduction": "This spell reverses the ethics of a person or group of people. While under the influence of this spell, a creature behaves in a manner opposite to the way he normally would behave. Thus, a shopkeeper influenced by inverted ethics will think it perfectly normal for someone to pick up an item from his shop and walk out the door without paying for it. If someone tried to pay for an item, he would be insulted. If the spell is cast on a shopper in a store, he would find it natural to steal the item, thinking that he is behaving in a proper way. If the spell is cast on a professed thief, he will no longer steal, choosing to pay for his goods instead.\n\nInverted ethics does not cause a creature to actively commit evil deeds (or good deeds). Thus, an affected creature will not go on a shoplifting rampage; he will steal only as the opportunity presents itself.\n\nThe spell affects one character per level of the caster within a 20' radius. Each target of the spell is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect.\n\nThe material component is a miniature golden balance (i.e., similar to the scales of justice).\n\nNotes: Common for priests with major access to the sphere of Chaos."

The depth can be lowered by up to 2 feet for every experience level of the priest. The water is lowered within a square area whose sides are 10 feet long per caster level. Thus, an 8th-level priest affects a volume up to 16 feet x 80 feet x 80 feet, a 9th-level caster affects a volume up to 18 feet x 90 feet x 90 feet, and so on. In extremely large and deep bodies of water, such as deep ocean, the spell creates a whirlpool that sweeps ships and similar craft downward, putting them at risk and rendering them unable to leave by normal movement for the duration of the spell. When cast on water elementals and other water-based creatures, this spell acts as a slow spell: The creature moves at half speed and makes half its usual number of attacks each round. The spell has no effect on other creatures.\n\nIts reverse, raise water, causes water or similar fluids to return to their highest natural level: spring flood, high tide, etc. This can make fords impassable, float grounded ships, and may even sweep away bridges at the DM's option. It negates lower water and vice versa.\n\nThe material components of this spell are the priest's holy (or unholy) symbol and a pinch of dust.\n\nNotes: Common for druids (PHB)."

        "Introduction": "This spell is similar to the wizard spell domination in that it establishes a telepathic link between the priest and the subject through which the priest can control the subject's bodily movements. There are some significant differences between the spells, however.\n\nElves and half-elves have no innate resistance to this spell. Priest and subject need not share a common language. The priest can force the subject into combat, but the subject's attack rolls suffer a -2 penalty. The priest cannot force the subject to cast spells or use any innate magical or magiclike abilities. The priest can force the subject to speak, although the priest cannot inject a full range of emotions into the subject's voice (everything said by the subject is in a monotone).\n\nThis spell gives the priest no access to the subject's thoughts, memory, or sensory apparatus. Thus, the priest cannot see through the subject's eyes. To control the subject, the priest must be within the range of the spell and must be able to see the subject. Breaking either of these conditions causes the spell to terminate immediately.\n\nThis spell requires a moderate level of concentration by the priest. While maintaining this spell, he can move or enter combat, but cannot cast another spell. If the priest is wounded, rendered unconscious, or killed, the spell immediately terminates.\n\nIf the priest is 10th level or lower, he or she cannot force the subject to perform particularly delicate actions, such as picking a lock. At 11th level or higher, however, this restriction is removed. The priest could thus force a thief to pick a lock. Any such delicate actions suffer a -15% penalty (or -3 on 1d20) to reflect the \"remote control\" nature of the action.\n\nThe material component is a mesh of fine threads that the priest loops around the fingertips of one hand and manipulates in the way that a puppeteer controls a puppet.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with major access to the sphere of Thought (ToM)."

For instance, he could recall every word from a five-minute conversation or every detail from a passage in a book.\n * Change the details of an event the subject actually experienced.\n * Implant a memory of an event the subject never experienced.\n\nCasting the spell takes one round. If the subject fails to save vs. spell, the caster proceeds with the spell by spending up to five minutes visualizing the memory he wishes to modify in the subject. If the caster's concentration is disturbed before the visualization is complete, the spell is lost.\n\nModified memory will not necessarily affect the subject's actions, particularly if they contradict his natural inclinations. An illogical modified memory, such as the subject recalling how much he enjoyed drinking poison, will be dismissed by the subject as a bad dream or a memory muddied by too much wine. More useful applications of modified memory include implanting memories of friendly encounters with the caster (inclining the subject to act favorably toward the caster), changing the details of orders given to the subject by a superior, or causing the subject to forget that the caster cheated him in a card game. The DM reserves the right to decide whether a modified memory is too nonsensical to significantly affect the subject.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with major access to the sphere of Thought (ToM)."

This action can be anything that requires a die roll—an attack, a saving throw, an attempt to use thieving skills, an ability check, or even an attempt to successfully teleport on target. The action must be something performed by a single creature.\n\nThe basic modification is 15% (15 on 1d100 or 3 on 1d20), plus an additional 5% per five levels of the caster. This modification can be either positive or negative, as deemed by the spellcaster. Thus, a 10th-level priest can modify a subject's saving throw or attack roll by +5 or -5, or a thief's \"climb walls\" roll by +25% or -25%. The priest may cast this spell on himself.\n\nFor a noncombat action such as an attempt to climb a wall, the priest simply casts the spell on the subject immediately before the action is attempted, informing the DM whether the modification is positive or negative. To use this spell in combat, the priest must specify the action to be affected (e.g., the target's next attack roll) and whether the modification will be positive or negative. The spell remains in effect until the subject attempts the specified action or until a number of rounds equal to the caster's level passes. If the latter occurs, the spell ends without effect.\n\nOnce the spell is cast, the priest does not need to maintain any level of concentration; the spell will function even if the casting priest is killed before the spell takes effect.\n\nThe subject of the spell has no way of knowing whether any modification made by this spell is positive or negative (or even whether he was the subject of the spell at all). Thus, a lying priest could claim to raise a thief's chance of climbing the wall, while actually lowering it. The thief would be none the wiser. However, an unwilling subject of this spell receives a normal saving throw to negate its effect.\n\nThe material components are a small cube of a thickened sugar-and-milk mixture and a cubic die of matching size. Both are consumed in the casting.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with major access to the sphere of Numbers (ToM)."

        "Introduction": "This spell enables the caster to cause a pool of normal water found in a natural setting to act as a scrying device. The pool can be of no greater diameter than 2 feet per level of the caster. The effect is to create a scrying device similar to a crystal ball. The scrying can extend only to the Ethereal Plane and the Inner Planes (which includes the paraelemental planes, the Demiplane of Shadow, etc.). General notes on scrying, detection by the subject, and penalties for attempting to scry beyond the caster's own plane are given in the DMG, as well as a description of the crystal ball item.\n\nThe following spells can be cast through a reflecting pool, with a 5% per level chance for operating correctly: detect magic, detect snares and pits, and detect poison. Each additional detection attempt requires a round of concentration, regardless of success. Infravision, if available, operates normally through the reflecting pool.\n\nThe image is nearly always hazy enough to prevent the reading of script of any type.\n\nThe material component is the oil extracted from such nuts as the hickory and the walnut, refined, and dropped in three measures upon the surface of the pool. (A measure need be no more than a single ounce of oil.)\n\nAt the DM's option, the casting of this spell may be limited to once per day.\n\nNotes: Common for druids (PHB).",

        "Introduction": "This unusual spell is similar to phantasmal force and other illusion magic, except that the priest who casts the spell is the only creature who automatically believes the results of the spell. The spell creates the illusion of any object, creature, or force, as long as it is within the boundaries of the spell's area of effect. The illusion is visual and tactile (that is, it can be seen and felt), but no other sensory stimuli are created.\n\nSolipsism is the opposite of normal illusions in that anyone other than the caster must make an active effort to believe (rather than dis believe) the illusion. Characters trying to believe the reality of a solipsistic illusion must make a saving throw vs. breath weapon, modified by the magical defense adjustment for Wisdom. A successful save means that the character believes the illusion and it is part of reality for him. A failed save means that the character cannot convince himself of the illusion's reality, and the illusion has no effect on him. A character can make a single attempt to believe each round.\n\nUnlike true illusions, the image created by this spell does more than just duplicate reality. The image formed is real for those who believe in it. The illusion has all the normal properties that its form and function allow. Thus, a solipsistic bridge spanning a chasm could be crossed by the priest and those who believed. All others would see the priest apparently walking out onto nothingness. Likewise, a solipsistic giant would cause real damage to those who believed it.\n\nThe illusion remains in effect for as long as the priest continues to concentrate on it, until the priest is struck in combat, or until he is rendered unconscious. The level of concentration required is not extreme; the priest can move normally and may engage in combat, but is unable to cast any spell while maintaining a solipsistic illusion.\n\nSolipsism can create only illusions that are external to the priest. Thus, the priest cannot create an illusion that he is the size of a giant, is unwounded, or has sprouted wings.\n\nThe material components are a lotus blossom that the priest must swallow and a bit of fleece.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with access to the sphere of Thought (ToM)."

The spell does not enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but any movements within the plants' normal capabilities are possible. Creatures entangled by the 1st-level spell of that name can be released. The power of the spell lasts for one round for each experience level of the casting priest.

It protects against spells, spell-like effects of magical items, and innate spell-like abilities of creatures. It does not protect against breath weapons or gaze attacks of any type.\n\nThe spell has several additional limitations. First, the caster must have directly experienced the effect of the specified spell. For example, if the caster has been attacked by a fireball spell at some time, he can use the spell immunity spell to provide protection from a fireball. Second, the spell cannot affect a creature already magically protected by a potion, protective spell, ring, or other device. Third, only a particular spell can be protected against, not a certain sphere of spells or a group of spells that are similar in effect; thus, a creature given immunity to the lightning bolt spell is still vulnerable to a shocking grasp spell.\n\nThe material component for spell immunity is the same as that for the spell to be protected against.\n\nNotes: Common for clerics (PHB)."

        "Introduction": "By means of this spell, the caster can change 1d4 sticks, plus one stick per experience level, into snakes; thus, a 9th-level priest can change 10-13 sticks into an equal number of snakes. These snakes attack as commanded by the priest. There must, of course, be sticks or similar pieces of wood (such as torches, spears, etc.) to turn into snakes. Such a stick cannot be larger than a staff. Sticks held by creatures are allowed a saving throw equal to that of the possessor (i.e., a spear held by an orc must roll the orc's saving throw vs. polymorph). Magical items, such as staves and enchanted spears, are not affected by the spell. Only sticks within the area of effect are changed.\n\nThe type of snake created varies, but a typical specimen has 2 Hit Dice, Armor Class 6, a movement rate of 9, and either constricts for 1d4+1 points of damage per round or bites for 1 point plus poison (if any). The chance of a snake thus changed being venomous is 5% per caster level, if the spellcaster desires. Thus, an 11th-level priest has a maximum 55% chance that any snake created by the spell is poisonous. The spell lasts for two rounds for each experience level of the spellcaster.\n\nThe material components of the spell are a small piece of bark and several snake scales.\n\nThe reverse spell changes normal-sized snakes to sticks for the same duration, or it negates the sticks to snakes spell according to the level of the priest countering the spell (for example, a 10th-level priest casting the reverse spell can turn 11-14 snakes back into sticks).\n\nNotes: Common for clerics and druids (PHB)."

Everyone who senses these thoughts, on the other hand, knows their source.\n\nThis spell causes the broadcast of only surface thoughts and motivations, not memories. There is no need for a common language between broadcaster and receivers; for this purpose, thoughts are considered to be symbolic, not dependent on language. The detail level of the thoughts is insufficient for others to learn specific skills from the subject. Thus, if the subject casts a spell, everyone within range knows what spell is being cast before it takes effect, but no one learns any knowledge about how the spell is cast.\n\nIf the broadcaster is invisible or hiding in shadows, the broadcast functions normally, and all receivers are aware that someone is in the vicinity whom they cannot see. While receivers cannot pinpoint the broadcaster's location, the broadcaster's thoughts will inevitably reveal his general position (\"Oh no, he's looking right at me,\" etc.). A character hiding in shadows will be automatically detected, while attacks against an invisible broadcaster suffer a -2 penalty, rather than the normal -4. This spell totally negates the chance of surprise by the broadcaster.\n\nThe subject must have an Intelligence score of 1 or more to become a broadcaster, and must have a \"normal\" mind as understood by PCs. Thoughts that are broadcast can be received only by individuals with Intelligence scores of 3 or better. An unwilling subject receives a normal saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effects.

If used from a high place such as a mountainside or tower, the caster can glide a maximum horizontal distance of 20 feet per foot of initial altitude—for example, if the priest used this spell and launched himself from a hilltop 800 feet high, he could glide a maximum distance of 16,000 feet, or about 3 miles.\n\nIf windborne is cast by a priest on level ground, the initial gust carries him aloft to a maximum altitude of 10 feet per caster level. From that point, he may then glide 10 feet per foot of initial altitude. For example, a 7th-level priest would ascend to an altitude of 70 feet and thus be able to glide for a total horizontal distance of 700 feet. He can choose to glide for a much shorter distance, but never less than his initial altitude.\n\nWhile gliding, the priest moves at a rate of 15 (or about 450 feet) with a maneuverability class of D. Each round, he drops between 20 and 40 feet. He can choose to descend at a much more rapid pace, dropping up to 200 feet per round without risk of a damaging impact upon landing.

Moving upward is similar to walking up a hill. A maximum upward angle of 45 degrees is possible at one-half the creature's movement rate, as is a maximum downward angle of 45 degrees at the normal movement rate. An air-walking creature is in control of its movement, except when a strong wind is blowing. In this case, the creature gains or loses 10 feet of movement for every 10 miles per hour of wind velocity. The creature can, at the DM's option, be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control of movement or suffering physical damage.\n\nThe spell can be placed upon a trained mount, so it can be ridden through the air. Of course, a mount not accustomed to such movement would certainly need careful and lengthy training, the details for which are up to the DM.\n\nThe material components for the spell are the priest's holy symbol and a bit of thistledown.\n\nNotes: Common for druids (PHB)."

The flame is magically preserved at the intensity it possessed when animated and does not weaken or fail even if it has nothing to burn. The priest can affect any natural fire within range, but magical fires (including breath weapons) can only be animated and controlled on a roll of 11 or higher on a d20, –1 per level or Hit Dice difference between the caster and the creature or spellcaster who created the flame in question. For example, a 9th-level priest can animate a flaming sphere cast by a 4th level wizard on a roll of 6 or better on 1d20.\n\nIn order to animate instantaneous effects such as a red dragon’s breath or a fireball, the priest must beat his opponent’s initiative in the round he casts this spell and succeed in his attempt to take control of the flame.\n\nUnder the priest’s direction, an animated flame can move at a rate of 12, although it cannot cross water or wet or muddy ground. If the priest directs the flame to leave the spell’s range, the spell ends and the flame stops and burns whatever it may be resting on. Animate flame can be a very effective weapon; the fire attacks with a THAC0 of 10 and may be able to strike several creatures in the same round, depending on its size. It inflicts damage as shown below: Creatures actually caught within the fire’s diameter are automatically hit (without an attack roll) for the listed damage. Very hot or unusually cold fires may inflict damage (at the DM’s discretion) as if they were one category larger or smaller. In addition to attacking the caster’s enemies, the fire will naturally cause any combustibles it comes into contact with to burn, as well; an animated fire can easily torch a small town, given a few rounds to move from building to building.\n\nThe animated flame can be dispelled normally. It can also be defeated by contact with a significant volume of water, ice, cold, or earth or dirt, just as a normal fire can be drowned or smothered.\n\nThe priest can affect a single fire of up to 1 foot in diameter per level of experience; if a natural fire is too large for him to animate, he can animate a smaller portion of it and command the portion he controls. Magical fires cannot be divided in this way, so it requires a very high-level priest to deflect the breath weapon of a red dragon!\n\nNotes: Uncommon for druids (PO:SM)."

Winds in excess of 73 miles per hour are of hurricane force.\n\nAn “eye” of 40-foot radius, in which the wind is calm, exists around the caster. Note that while the spell can be used underground, if the spell is cast in an area smaller than the area of effect, the eye shrinks 1 foot for every foot of confinement. For example, if the area of effect is a 360-foot area, the eye shrinks by 10 feet to a 30-foot radius; a space under 320 feet in a radius would eliminate the eye and subject the spellcaster to the effects of the wind. Once the spell is cast, the wind force increases or decreases by 3 miles per hour per round until the maximum or minimum speed is attained. The caster, with one round of complete concentration, can stabilize the wind at its current strength, or set it to increase or decrease. However, the rate of the change cannot be altered. The spell remains in force for one turn for each level of experience of the caster. When the spell is exhausted, the force of the wind wanes or waxes at the same rate, until it reaches the level it was at before the spell took effect. Another caster can use a control winds spell to counter the effects of a like spell up to the limits of his own ability.\n\nNotes: Common for druids (PHB)."

Disguise cannot change the size category of the unit's members. Thus, a unit of humans may appear to be a unit of elves, but may not appear as a unit of giants or halflings. The spell does not affect the size of the overall unit; a unit of 50 creatures will still appear to be a unit of 50 creatures.\n\nThe disguised unit may appear to be carrying any melee or personal missile weapons (e.g., axes, long swords, crossbows, etc.), and may appear to be wearing any type of armor. In combat, however, the unit attacks and defends with its real weapons and armor regardless of the gear they may appear to be carrying.\n\nDisguise is most effective at long range. If another unit moves within 20 yards of a disguised unit, it automatically sees through the illusion.\n\nThe caster automatically sees through the illusion. Members of the subject unit see no change in their appearance. True seeing or similar magic is required for other individuals to see through the disguise (unless they move within 20 yards of the unit).\n\nThe material components are a fine silk veil and a length of woven platinum wire.

Creatures in the insect plague, regardless of Armor Class, sustain 1 point of damage for each round they remain within, due to the bites and stings of the insects. Invisibility is no protection. All creatures with 2 or fewer Hit Dice will automatically move at their fastest possible speed in a random direction until they are more than 240 yards away from the insects. Creatures with fewer than 5 Hit Dice must check morale; failure means they run as described above.\n\nHeavy smoke drives off insects within its bounds. Fire also drives insects away. For example, a wall of fire in a ring shape keeps a subsequently cast insect plague outside its confines, but a fireball spell simply clears insects from its blast area for one round. A single torch is ineffective against this vast horde of insects. Lightning, cold, or ice are likewise ineffective, while a strong wind that covers the entire plague area disperses the insects and ends the spell. The plague lasts two rounds for each level of the caster, and thereafter the insects disperse.\n\nThe insects swarm in an area that centers around a summoning point determined by the spellcaster. The point can be up to 120 yards away from the priest. The insect plague does not move thereafter for as long as it lasts.

This means that the subject can cast any spells memorized before the memory wrack took effect, but he is likely to have difficulty casting the spell as described below.\n\nThe subject of this spell has a limited ability to act. He is restricted to one action at a time and must concentrate mightily to keep the situation and any planned actions in short-term memory. As long as the subject is able to maintain concentration, he may act normally within these limits.\n\nIf the subject is distracted (he is struck in combat, affected by a spell, startled, surprised, or a similar event occurs), he forgets everything that occurred from the onset of the spell to the moment of distraction. The subject must re-evaluate the situation as if it had just come to pass.\n\nConsider the following example. The subject of the spell is a soldier assigned to guard the entrance to a building. The priest arrives and casts memory wrack on the guard. The guard has no problem remembering his orders, since he received them before the onset of the spell. He also remembers the arrival of the priest. The priest now tries to convince the guard that he is authorized to enter the building. The guard refuses him entry. The priest now picks up a rock and throws it at the guard, striking him and distracting him. The guard forgets everything that happened between the onset of the spell and the moment the rock struck. He forgets that the priest has already tried to con him and that he threw a rock at him. He must reevaluate the situation as though the priest had just arrived. The priest is free to make another attempt at entering the building.\n\nWhen the spell expires, the subject remembers nothing that happened while the spell was in effect, possibly leading to amusing consequences (\"By the gods, how did I get here?\").\n\nThe material component is a ruby of at least 200 gp value, which is crushed during the casting.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with major access to the sphere of Thought (ToM)."

        "Introduction": "This spell allows the priest to create one specific form of insanity in the subject. Five forms of insanity are possible through this spell.\n\nSchizophrenia: This form of insanity is characterized by personality loss. The subject has no personality of his own, so he selects a role model and makes every possible attempt to behave like that character. The chosen role model will be as different from the subject as possible. (Thus, an insane wizard might begin to follow the habits of a warrior.) Obviously, a warrior who believes himself to be a wizard will be unable to cast spells (he might think that he's casting spells, or he might construct a sophisticated series of excuses explaining why he's \"not in the mood for magic\" at the moment). A character who emulates a member of another class does not gain any of the skills of that class and makes all attacks and saving throws as appropriate to his true class. Certain consequences might arise if the character's emulation causes him to break restrictions of his class. For example, a priest emulating a warrior might break his deity's prohibition against edged weapons, or a paladin might emulate a Neutral Evil thief. Both will suffer the appropriate consequences as if they had been compelled to violate their beliefs while charmed. Such characters will certainly have to atone for their actions once they return to normal.\n\nDementia praecox: The subject is totally uninterested in any undertaking. Nothing seems worthwhile, and the individual is lethargic and filled with tremendous feelings of boredom and dissatisfaction. No matter how important the situation, it is 50% likely that the subject will ignore it as meaningless.\n\nDelusional insanity: The subject is convinced that he is a famous figure: a monarch, demi-god, or similar personage. Characters who fail to recognize the subject with the honor he deserves incur great hostility or disbelief. The subject acts appropriately to a station that he does not hold. He directs orders at real and imaginary creatures and draws upon resources that do not exist.\n\nParanoia: The subject is convinced that \"they\" (whoever they are) are spying on him and plotting against him. Everyone around the subject, even friends and allies, is part of the plot. If any other character acts in a way that the subject can interpret as reinforcing this delusion, the subject has a 20% chance of reacting with violence.\n\nHallucinatory insanity: The subject sees, hears, and otherwise senses things that do not exist. The more stressful the situation is to the subject, the more likely he will hallucinate. Although most hallucinations are external to the subject (that is, he perceives creatures, objects, and conditions that do not exist), there is a 10% chance that any hallucination will involve the subject's self-perception. For example, the subject might suddenly believe and act as if he had sprouted wings, grown to giant size, etc.\n\nWhen this spell is cast by a priest of 13th level or lower, the DM chooses or randomly selects one of these forms of insanity (and should feel free to invent other interesting symptoms). If the priest is 14th level or higher, he can personally select the form of insanity to afflict the subject.\n\nWhile under the effect of this spell, the subject can cast spells and use innate powers; the use of these abilities will be in accordance with the symptoms of the insanity, however. Player characters affected by this spell should be encouraged to role-play the appropriate effects to the limit.\n\nThe duration of this spell depends on the sum of the subject's Intelligence and Wisdom scores. A saving throw is allowed on a periodic basis depending on this total. The spell is broken if a successful saving throw is rolled. Refer to the table that follows.\n\nThe effects of this spell can be removed by a limited wish, wish (or equally powerful magic), or by a heal spell cast for this specific purpose.\n\nThe material component is a small bust of a human head, about 3\" in height, made from fine, delicate china. The priest shatters this bust during the casting.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with major access to the sphere of Thought."

The spellcaster can easily make the moonbeam move to any area that he can see and point to. This makes the spell an effective way to spotlight something, an opponent, for example. While the moonbeam spell does not eliminate all shadows, a creature centered in a moonbeam is most certainly visible. The reflected light from this spell enables dim visual perception 10 yards beyond the area of effect, but it does not shed a telltale glow that would negate surprise. The light does not adversely affect infravision. The caster can dim the beam to near darkness if desired. The beam has, in addition, all the properties of true moonlight and can induce a lycanthropic change (of a creature in the beam), unless the DM rules otherwise.\n\nThe material components are several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar (moonstone).\n\nNotes: Common for druids (PHB)."

The pass plant spell functions so that the movement takes only one round. The caster can, at his option, remain within the receiving tree for a maximum of one round per level of experience. Otherwise, he can step forth immediately. Should no like tree be in range, the caster simply remains within the first tree, does not pass elsewhere, and must step forth in the appropriate number of rounds.

The rainbow spell has two applications, and the priest can choose the desired one at the time of casting. These applications are as follows:\n\nBow: The spell creates a shimmering, multi-layered short composite bow of rainbow hues. It is light and easy to pull, so that any character can use it without penalty for non-proficiency. It is magical: Each of its shimmering missiles is the equivalent of a +2 weapon, including attack and damage bonuses. Magic resistance can negate the effect of any missile fired from the bow. The bow fires seven missiles before disappearing. It can be fired up to four times per round. Each time a missile is fired, one hue leaves the bow, corresponding to the color of arrow that is released. Each color of arrow has the ability to cause double damage to certain creatures, as follows:\n\n\n * Red: Fire dwellers/users and fire elementals\n * Orange: Creatures or constructs of clay, sand, earth, stone or similar materials, and earth elementals Yellow: Vegetable opponents (including fungus creatures, shambling mounds, treants, and so on)\n * Green: Aquatic creatures and water elementals\n * Blue: Aerial creatures, electricity-using creatures, and air elementals\n * Indigo: Acid-using or poison-using creatures\n * Violet: Metallic or regenerating creatures\n\nWhen the bow is drawn, an arrow of the appropriate color magically appears, nocked and ready. If no color is requested, or a color that has already been used is asked for, then the next arrow (in the order of the spectrum) appears.\n\n\n * Bridge: The caster causes the rainbow to form a seven-hued bridge up to 3 feet wide per level of the caster. It must be at least 20 feet long and can be as long as 120 yards, according to the caster's desire. It lasts as long as the spell's duration or until ordered out of existence by the caster.\n\nThe components for this spell are the priest's holy symbol and a vial of holy water. If no rainbow is in the vicinity, the caster can substitute a diamond of not less than 1,000 gp value, specially prepared with bless and prayer spells while in sight of a rainbow. The holy water and diamond disappear when the spell is cast.\n\nNotes: Common for druids (PHB)."

        "Introduction": "This cooperative spell can be cast by either a single priest or a group of priests. Thoughtwave allows the priest to send a short but powerful message to one or more specific individuals, informing them of his situation and general location. The spell instantly generates a powerful mental impulse indicative of the caster's general mental state—anger, fear, pain, despair, etc.\n\nThe caster can designate as many as ten persons to receive this message, provided they can all be specifically named or grouped in a general category. Thus, the caster could designate a group of characters by name or could target \"fellow priests,\" \"superiors,\" \"adventuring companions,\" \"knights of Lord Harcourt,\" or \"villagers of Dopp.\" If more than ten individuals are in the group, those closest to the source will receive the impulse.\n\nThere is no range limitation to the spell, although it cannot be projected outside the plane occupied by the caster.\n\nCreatures receiving the impulse automatically know who sent it (even if they have never met the priest before) and gain a clear indication of the mood and situation of the caster. Recipients also intuitively know the general source of the spell, although they are unable to pinpoint rooms, dungeon levels, or landmarks. For example, a fighter could suddenly be struck by an image of Father Rastibon, who is injured and in great pain somewhere along the forest road. A priest might suddenly sense that his patriarch is being tortured in the dungeons of Castle Varrack.\n\nThe spell can also be cast by more than one priest, allowing them to either contact greater numbers of individuals or increase the intensity of the message. If greater numbers are desired, ten characters are contacted per priest involved in the casting.\n\nIncreasing the intensity of the message makes it more compelling. Doubling the intensity (requiring at least three priests) causes the message to act as a suggestion. In this case, the effect is limited to a single target. Tripling the intensity (requiring at least five priests) gives the spell the force of a quest. This effect is also limited to a single target. In both cases, the target is allowed a saving throw to avoid the effect of the suggestion or quest.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with major access to the sphere of Thought (ToM)."

For example, the walls in a simple tunnel driven through solid rock are subject to this spell, but if the tunnel were lined with brick or stones that had been worked into blocks, a transmute rock to mud spell could not harm them. This spell still is very useful in a siege, however, as virtually all castles must be built upon bedrock in order to support the weight of the walls. It is possible to use a transmute rock to mud spell to undermine a wall by attacking the bedrock underneath, provided that the spell has enough area to reach under the wall and that the mud can flow out and leave a cavity under the wall. In some cases it might be necessary to employ sappers or a dig spell to get at the bedrock and provide a place for the mud to go.

The spell's effect must be centered on a specific area, for it creates an invisible spherical boundary up to 10 feet in diameter. The effect is not mobile; it cannot move with a living creature.\n\nWhile within the area of effect of this spell, the priest (and only the priest) gains several special abilities:\n\n\n * His sense of sight is magically enhanced. He can see through normal darkness and can see invisible creatures and objects. He cannot see through solid objects, however, and the range of his magical sight is limited to 60 feet.\n * The priest has no need for food, water, or rest. He does not feel fatigue and regenerates 1 hit point per hour spent within the circle. However, he does not actually rest and therefore cannot regain spells until he sleeps.\n * He is totally immune to the effects of magical and natural fear, as well as sleep and charm spells.\n\nIf the priest leaves the circle, the spell is broken. When the spell ends, the priest must rest for 1 turn per hour (or portion thereof) spent in the circle. If the priest is forced into action (by being attacked, for example), he can move at only half his normal movement rate, has an Armor Class penalty of -2, an attack penalty of -2, and loses all Dexterity combat bonuses.\n\nTo cast this spell, the priest must trace a circle of sigils and runes 10 feet in diameter using a special ink containing the powder of a crushed sapphire (at least 1,000 gp value) and a drop of holy water. This procedure takes 1 turn to complete.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for priests with major access to the Guardian sphere (ToM).",

The intruder must be larger than a normal rat (larger than one-half cubic foot or weighing more than three pounds). When activated, the enchanted surface moves toward the opposite surface at a rate of 3 feet per round. Unless the spell is canceled by the caster, the enchanted surface continues to move until one of the following events occurs:\n\n\n * A creature with sufficient Strength (minimum score of 19) stops the enchanted surface from moving by succeeding a Strength check. Such a creature suffers no damage from the enchanted surface. If the creature prevents the enchanted surface from moving for three consecutive rounds, the wall returns to its original position and the spell is negated. If multiple creatures attempt to stop the wall, the highest strength score is used as a base score; one point is added to that score for every creature assisting. Thus, a creature with 16 Strength assisted by three creatures could attempt to stop the wall.\n * A strong or heavy object made of stone, wood, or metal is placed in the path of the wall. If the item survives a saving throw vs. crushing blow, the object successfully braces the wall. If the object holds for three consecutive rounds, the surface returns to its original position and the spell is negated. The DM must use discretion in determining the types of objects that will brace the wall.\n * Dispel magic or a similar spell or magical item is used to cancel the crushing wall.\n\nCreatures can avoid being crushed by using a potion of diminution, potion of gaseous form, or other devices or spells that reduce size. The crushing wall almost never touches the opposite wall, usually being stopped by debris. A gap of two inches or more usually remains between the walls.\n\nIf the wall is not stopped, it causes crushing damage to everyone in the room. All creatures must make a saving throw vs. death. Those who fail are crushed to death. Those who save successfully suffer 5d10 points of damage. When the wall can move no farther, it returns to its original position and the spell is negated.\n\nThe material components are a 1-inch iron cube and a walnut shell.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with major access to the sphere of Wards (ToM)."

However, since these objects or creatures temporarily do not exist for the priest, he can take no action against them. If the creatures attack, the caster receives no Dexterity bonus to armor class (since this bonus represents dodging, and the priest is unable to dodge a creature that does not exist for him).\n\nThe caster can attempt to disbelieve as many as four creatures within 60 feet of his position at the time of casting. He disbelieves the same four creatures for the duration of the spell. Alternatively, the priest can disbelieve any or all inanimate objects of up to 20-cubic-yard volume (thus, he may disbelieve a 12 foot by 15 foot area of 3-foot-thick wall). This volume must be centered on a point no more than 20 yards from the caster. These two options are mutually exclusive; the priest can disbelieve only creatures or objects, not a combination of both.\n\nDisbelieving a creature includes all gear, equipment, or treasure carried or worn by that creature; it does not include other objects that come into contact with that creature, such as walls, doors, chairs, etc.\n\nDisbelief is not automatic; it requires an extreme effort. To successfully disbelieve, the priest must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation. A successful save means the priest has disbelieved; an unsuccessful check means that the spell has failed and the priest has not convinced himself of the creatures' or objects' non-existence.\n\nWhile this spell is in effect, the DM must record any damage suffered by the priest from disbelieved creatures. When the spell ends, the caster makes a saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is successful, the priest suffers only one-eighth of any damage inflicted by the creatures (round all fractions down); if the priest fails the saving throw, he suffers one-half of any damage inflicted (round fractions down).\n\nNotes: Common for to priest with major access to the sphere of Thought (ToM)."

The warping effect of the field causes any melee or hand-to-hand attack to miss 50% of the time—even if the roll allows an attack to continue, the priest still gains a –2 bonus to his Armor Class. Normal missiles or hurled weapons miss automatically as the entropy shield deflects them from the caster. Even magical missile attacks (produce flame, magic missile, or Melf's acid arrow, for example), siege engines, and giant-thrown boulders may be deflected as if they were hand-to-hand attacks.\n\nAgainst spells or effects that produce energy, gas, or other physical attack forms (fireball, lightning bolt, cloudkill, and other such spells) the entropy shield provides a 50% chance that the attack simply does not affect the protected priest. Even if the harmful energy or matter penetrates the shield, the caster gains a +2 bonus on his saving throw. This does not cause a spell to fizzle or fail; a priest standing in the middle of a fireball is simply not touched by the spell, which will inflict its normal damage on anyone else in the area of effect. Any spell or effect that does not create matter or energy to harm or hinder the victim can pass through the entropy shield normally, so mind-based attacks and magical effects such as petrification, paralyzation, enfeeblement, or polymorph (to name a few) can still affect the priest.\n\nIn addition to its defensive benefits, the entropy shield has the ability to repel normal or giant-sized animals and creatures of lawful alignment, such as extraplanar monsters from the lawful planes. Any such creature attempting to attack the shielded priest in hand-to-hand combat must roll a saving throw vs. spell at the end of the round. If the creature fails, it recoils from the priest and cannot attack him physically for the remainder of the spell's duration (although it could decide to turn on one of the priest's companions).\n\nThe material component for this spell is a gemstone worth at least 100 gold pieces that has been exposed to the chaotic energies of Limbo.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for priests with major access to the sphere of Chaos (PO:SM)."

        "Introduction": "This spell changes the characteristics of a square region of terrain. The area can be no more than 120 yards on a side. The priest can effectively turn a flat plain into a slope of any direction, or may flatten an existing slope. The spell does not allow the priest to alter the pull of gravity, however.\n\nThis spell lets the priest create or negate a height differential of as much as 20 feet (a 2\" slope in BATTLE SYSTEM™ rules measurements) within the area of effect. This can have various consequences; the best way to discuss the effects is by example.\n\nExample 1: Two units face each other on a flat plain. The priest can alter the slope of the terrain so that one unit is 2\" of elevation higher than the other. The unit that is upslope gains the combat benefits for higher ground, and the unit that is downslope must pay the movement cost for moving uphill if it wishes to approach the other unit.\n\nExample 2: One unit is on flat terrain; another unit, 6\" away, is on a hill of 2\" elevation. Using this spell, the priest can effectively eliminate this difference in elevation (raising the low ground or lowering the high ground). All combat and movement involving these two units is then conducted as if there were no elevation difference (i.e., no movement penalty, no combat benefit for higher ground, etc.). Alternatively, the priest could increase the height differential by 2\". Combat and movement would now be conducted as if the total difference in elevation were 4\".\n\nExample 3: A unit faces a hill of 3\" elevation. The priest casts gravity variation, decreasing the effective elevation of the hill to 1\". The unit pays a lower movement point cost to climb the hill. Alternatively, if the unit facing the hill were an enemy unit, the priest could increase the effective elevation to 5\".\n\nThe priest must specify the degree and direction of change at the moment of casting. These parameters cannot be changed while the spell remains in effect.\n\nGravity variation can have dramatic effects on siege engines and towers. Most siege engines can be moved only on the most gentle of slopes. By raising or lowering the effective elevation of siege engines by 2\", the priest can totally immobilize them by positioning them on a slope too steep to negotiate. In the case of siege towers, there is a 50% chance that the structures will topple over (totally destroying them).\n\nThe material component is a tiny plumb bob; the plumb line must be made of platinum wire while the bob itself must be a gem of at least 1,000 gp value. The device is consumed in the casting.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with major access to the sphere of War."

The tree upon which the spell is cast must be within 10 feet of the caster's dwelling place, within a place sacred to the caster, or within 100 yards of something that the caster wishes to guard or protect.\n\nThe liveoak spell can be cast upon a healthy tree of small, medium, or large size, according to desire and availability. A triggering phrase of up to maximum of one word per level of the spellcaster is then placed upon the targeted oak. For instance, “Attack any persons who come near without first saying sacred mistletoe” is an 11-word trigger phrase that could be used by a caster of 11th level or higher casting the spell. The liveoak spell triggers the tree into animating as a treant of equivalent size, an Armor Class of 0 and with two attacks per round, but with only a 30-feet-per-round movement rate.\n\nA tree enchanted by this spell radiates a magical aura (if checked for), and can be returned to normal by a successful casting of a dispel magic spell, or upon the desire of the caster who enchanted it.

Damage to the tree can be healed with a plant growth spell, which restores 3d4 points of damage.

The caster of the mirror may direct spells and missile attacks normally through the space occupied by the mirror.\n\nIn the case of physical attacks, the attacker must roll to hit himself (without the armor class benefits of Dexterity or shield). Spells turned back may require the caster to make a saving throw vs. his own spell. In both of these cases, range is important. If the distance between the initiator of the attack and the physical mirror is more than twice the range of the attack, the attacker is safe; the attack has insufficient range to travel from the attacker to the mirror and back again.\n\nWhen the priest casts the spell, he must specify the location and orientation of the physical mirror disk.

Thus, the priest may seclude a comrade in the extradimensional space, walk past some guards into a building, then release the comrade.\n\nIf any other form of extradimensional space (such as a bag of holding ) is taken into the space created by seclusion, both spaces are ruptured and all contents are expelled onto the Astral plane. Extradimensional manipulation can temporarily prevent this.\n\nThe material components are a tiny crystal box of the finest workmanship (worth at least 1,500 gp) and a gem of at least 250 gp value. The gem is consumed in the casting; the box is not.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with major access to the sphere of Numbers (ToM)."

It is not possible for the priest to give the stone to another character to throw.\n\nThe stone can be hurled up to 30 yards. The priest must roll normally to hit; he gains a +3 bonus to his attack roll and suffers no penalty for non-weapon proficiency. In addition, the glowing gem is considered a +3 weapon for determining whether a creature can be struck (creatures hit only by magical weapons, for example). There is no damage bonus, however.\n\nWhen it hits, the gem bursts with a brilliant, searing flash that causes 6d6 points of fire damage to the target and blinds him for 1d6 rounds.

        "Introduction": "The great circle is a powerful cooperative spell that can be used only by four or more priests, each casting the spell simultaneously. Because of the nature of this spell and its casting time, it is often used to cleanse grounds in preparation for the construction of a temple or sanctuary.\n\nWhen casting the great circle, the priests stand in a circle of no more than 20-foot diameter. Each faces inward; when the spell is completed, each priest faces outward, directing the energy of the spell.\n\nWhen the casting is complete, the spell takes the form of a radiant halo of golden light 20 feet above the ground. This halo quickly expands in a shimmering wave. It can pass through objects, with small arcs of the halo disappearing momentarily and reappearing on the far side. As the halo moves, it generates a high-pitched hum that varies in pitch, almost like a chorus. The halo moves slowly at first, but builds speed, reaching its maximum range at the end of one round.\n\nThe radius of the golden halo is dependent on the number of priests casting the spell. Each priest adds 60 feet to the radius. Thus, four priests could generate a halo that extends 240 feet in all directions from the circle of priests. Theoretically, there is no limit to the number of priests who may contribute to this spell, but the need for the priests to be within a 20-foot diameter circle sets a practical limit of 20 casters.\n\nThe halo is pure energy tapped from the Positive Material plane. It causes harm to undead and evil beings within the area of effect. Undead creatures of 8 or fewer hit dice are instantly destroyed and are not allowed a saving throw to avoid the effect. More powerful undead suffer 1d8 points of damage per caster. A successful saving throw vs. death magic reduces this damage to half. Creatures of evil alignment suffer 1d6 points of damage per caster (a saving throw is allowed for half-damage).\n\nThe reverse of this spell, the black circle, creates a ring of shimmering black energy. Paladins and priests of good alignment suffer 1d10 points of damage per priest in the circle. All other good creatures suffer 1d4 points of damage per caster. Affected creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. death magic to reduce the damage to one-half.\n\nNotes: Uncommon spell for clerics (ToM)."

        "Introduction": "When this spell is cast, waves of force roll forth from the caster, moving in the direction he faces and causing all wooden objects in the path of the spell to be pushed away from the caster to the limit of the area of effect. Wooden objects above 3 inches in diameter that are fixed firmly are not affected, but loose objects (movable mantles, siege towers, etc.) move back. Objects less than 3 inches in diameter that are fixed splinter and break, and the pieces move with the wave of force. Thus, objects such as wooden shields, spears, wooden weapon shafts and hafts, and arrows and bolts are pushed back, dragging those carrying them with them. If a spear is planted to prevent this forced movement, it splinters. Even magical items with wooden sections are turned, although an anti-magic shell blocks the effects. A successful dispel magic spell ends the effect. Otherwise, the turn wood spell lasts for one round for each experience level of the caster.\n\nThe waves of force continue to sweep down the set path for the spell's duration, pushing back wooden objects in the area of effect at a rate of 40 feet per melee round. The length of the path is 20 feet per level of the caster. Thus if a 14th-level priest casts a turn wood spell, the area of effect is 120 feet wide by 280 feet long, and the spell lasts 14 rounds.

Any creature breaking through (or crashing into) the wall of thorns suffers 8 points of damage, plus an additional amount of damage equal to the creature's AC. Negative ACs subtract from the base 8 points of damage, but no adjustment is made for Dexterity. Any creature within the area of effect of the spell when it is cast, crashes into the wall of thorns and must break through to move. The damage is based on each 10-foot thickness of the barrier.\n\nIf the wall of thorns is chopped at, it takes at least four turns to cut a path through a 10-foot thickness. Normal fire cannot harm the barrier, but magical fires burn away the barrier in two turns, creating a wall of fire effect while doing so (see wall of fire spell). In this case, the cool side of the wall is that closest to the caster of the thorn wall.\n\nThe nearest edge of the wall of thorns appears up to 80 yards distant from the caster, as he desires. The spell's duration is one turn for each level of experience of the caster, and it covers one 10-foot cube per level of the caster in whatever shape the caster desires. Thus a 14th-level caster could create a wall of thorns up to 70 feet long by 20 feet high (or deep) by 10 feet deep (or high), a 10-foot-high by 10-foot-wide by 140-foot-long wall to block a dungeon passage, or any other sort of shape that suited his needs. The caster can also create a wall of 5-foot thickness, which inflicts half damage but can be doubled in one of the other dimensions. Note that those with the ability to pass through overgrown areas are not hindered by this barrier. The caster can dismiss the barrier on command.\n\nNotes: Common for druids (PHB)."

The vehicle and steeds are struck only by magical weapons or by water (one quart of which inflicts 1 point of damage). They are Armor Class 2, and each requires 30 points of damage to dispel. Naturally, fire has no effect upon either the vehicle or its steeds, but magical fires other than those of the chariot can affect the riders. Other spells, such as a successful dispel magic or holy word, will force the chariot back to its home plane, without its passengers. The chariot can be summoned only once per week.\n\nThe material components are a small piece of wood, two holly berries, and a fire source at least equal to a torch.\n\nNotes: Common for clerics and druids (PHB)."

Weather conditions have three components: precipitation, temperature, and wind. The spell can change these conditions according to the following chart:\n\nThe upper-case headings represent existing weather conditions. The lower-case headings below are the new conditions to which the caster can change the existing conditions. In addition, the caster can control the direction of the wind. For example, a day that is clear, warm, and with moderate wind can be controlled to become hazy, hot, and calm. Contradictions are not possible—fog and strong wind, for example. Multiple control weather spells can be used only in succession.\n\nThe material components for this spell are the priest's religious symbol, incense, and prayer beads or similar prayer object. Obviously, the spell functions only in areas where there are appropriate climatic conditions.\n\nIf Weather is a major sphere for the priest (as it is for druids), duration and area are doubled, and the caster can change the prevailing weather by two places.

        "Introduction": "The ritual required to cast this spell is time-consuming and extremely complex. As its name implies, illusory fortification creates an illusion of a wall of heavy stonework up to 30 feet tall and 160 yards long, topped with crenellations. The illusory wall can be of any color and apparent age, potentially allowing the caster to match the false wall with the real walls of an existing castle. The illusory wall must be continuous (it cannot form two or more shorter walls), but it can follow any corners or bends that the caster desires.\n\nIn addition to the wall, the spell creates the illusion of constant movement among the crenellations, as if defending troops were moving atop the wall. The formation of the crenellations makes it impossible for a distant observer to determine exactly how many and what types of defenders are present on the illusory fortification.\n\nThe illusory wall remains in existence for 2d12 hours unless the spell is terminated earlier.\n\nThe spell has one very significant limitation: it is strictly two-dimensional and is visible from only one side (the side that the caster deems to be the \"outside\"). When viewed from the outside, the wall appears real; when viewed from the end, from above, or from the \"inside,\" the wall is totally invisible except for a faint outline of the shape of the wall. This means that friendly troops, concealed from enemy view by the illusory wall, can see their opponents clearly. The wall is most effective if friendly troops are informed of the wall's presence and are careful not to walk through the illusion. Such an occurrence does not end the spell, but it will probably advise the enemy of the nature of the wall.\n\nSpells cast at the wall and shots fired at the illusory fortification by siege engines appear to strike the wall and inflict normal damage. In reality, the missiles or spells pass through the illusion, possibly striking troops or real fortifications beyond. Such \"hits\" do not disturb the illusion.\n\nAs soon as an enemy unit moves within 10 yards of the illusory fortification, the spell terminates and the wall vanishes.\n\nThere are two ways in which the spell can be terminated before it expires. First, the priest can terminate the spell at any time. Second, if a friendly unit makes an attack, whether melee or missile combat, through the illusory wall from the \"inside\" to the \"outside,\" the spell terminates instantly.\n\nOnce the illusory fortification has been created, the priest does not need to concentrate on the wall. The spell remains in effect even if the casting priest is killed in the interim.\n\nThe material components are the priest's holy symbol, a handful of stones, powdered mortar, and a gem worth at least 3,000 gp. All components except the holy symbol are consumed in the casting.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with major access to the sphere of War."

A wish spell can restore a reincarnated character to its original form and status.\n\nIf an unusual creature form is indicated, the DM can (at his option only) use the guidelines for new player character races to allow the character to earn experience and advance in levels, although this may not be in the same class as before. If the reincarnated character returns as a creature eligible to be the same class as he was previously (i.e., a human fighter returns as an elf), the reincarnated character has half his previous levels and hit points.

The engines can move at a rate of 20 yards per turn and are unaffected by terrain considerations. (The caster can choose to slow them when passing through rough terrain to aid the illusion of reality.)\n\nShadow engines cannot carry real troops. They can be fired at the same rate as real engines of the appropriate type, but a hit causes only one-half the damage normal for that type of engine (round fractions down).\n\nA shadow engine remains in existence until the spell duration expires, until an enemy unit approaches within 10 yards, or until it suffers damage from an enemy missile attack. When any of these conditions occur, the engine vanishes. If a single spell has created multiple engines, only the engine struck vanishes; the others remain.\n\nThe crew associated with a shadow engine must remain with that engine; it cannot move more than 5 yards away from the engine itself.\n\nShadow engines can move independently of other engines created by the spell as long as they remain within the area of effect and remain within 240 yards of the caster. The caster must maintain concentration to control the shadow engines. He cannot cast any other spells, and he is limited to a movement rate of 6. If the caster is struck for damage, the shadow engines vanish.\n\nThe material component is a finely detailed miniature model of a siege engine (of any type), which is consumed during the casting.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with major access to the sphere of War."

This point may be anywhere within 50 yards of the caster, including in midair.\n\nWhen the spell is completed, this center of effect gains a gravity field equal to the force felt at the surface of the earth. In other words, gravity is centered at this point; everything within 50 feet of this center that is not attached to something immovable will fall toward the selected point.\n\nThis localized gravity affects only loose objects and creatures capable of movement (i.e., not trees, whose roots are buried in the ground). It does not affect the ground itself—soil, plants, desert sand, lake water, etc. are immune to the effect.\n\nAn object falling toward the center of gravity gains speed exactly as it would if it were falling toward the ground.

If objects are already at the center, newly arriving objects will slam into them, causing normal falling damage (1d6 per 10 feet) to the newly arriving objects.

An orc is 10 feet away from the center of effect when the spell is cast. He falls 10 feet to the center and stops. His companion, a bandit, is 30 feet from the center. It takes him longer to fall to the center, so the orc is already there when he arrives, and the two characters collide forcefully.

The orc must save vs. paralyzation or suffer half that amount.\n\nOther things are caught in the effect as well. The bandit's horse was 50 feet away from the center of effect, so it arrives at the center after the orc and the bandit. It falls 50 feet, suffering 5d6 points of damage, and potentially inflicting half that amount on both the orc and the bandit.\n\nThe center of effect can be anywhere within 50 yards of the priest. Possibly one of the most destructive uses of this spell is to cast it directly on an enemy creature. Everyone and everything within 50 feet of that creature falls toward him and strikes him, inflicting damage.\n\nWhen the spell terminates, gravity returns to normal. If the spell has lifted any characters or objects off the ground, they immediately fall back to the ground, suffering the appropriate amount of falling damage.\n\nThe material components are a lodestone and a sphere of obsidian, both of which are consumed in the casting.",

(DMs may rule that the most powerful of magics, such as wishes, and creatures of demigod or higher status can affect the subject.)\n\nWhen the priest casts the spell, he or she states the duration for which the spell will remain in effect (the maximum is one full day per level of the caster). Once the spell is cast, this duration cannot be changed; the priest cannot terminate the spell before the stated time has elapsed.\n\nIf the subject is unwilling to be affected by the spell, the priest must touch the victim for the spell to take effect; the subject receives a normal saving throw to resist the effects. A willing subject need not make a saving throw.\n\nThe priest may cast this spell on himself if desired. This spell can provide a powerful defensive maneuver; while the spell is in effect, the subject is totally invulnerable. Timelessness is also an effective form of long-term imprisonment, as long as the priest is around to cast the spell again at the appropriate time.\n\nThis is an exceptionally powerful spell. Casting it puts a significant strain on the priest. Each time he casts timelessness, the priest must make a system shock roll. If the priest fails this throw, he or she permanently loses 1 point of Constitution.\n\nThe material components are a gem worth at least 1,000 gp and a small cylinder of obsidian.

        "Introduction": "This mighty spell summons a tsunami, or gigantic wave, from any major body of water. The body of water must be at least 1 mile in width, so in most circumstances the tsunami can only be summoned from the sea, large lakes, or extremely big rivers. The wave is 2 feet high and 10 feet long for each level of experience of the caster, so a 15th-level priest would summon a tsunami 30 feet high and 150 feet wide. The wave can appear anywhere within the spell’s range and immediately sweeps forward in the direction specified by the caster. This may take it out of the allowed range or even back at the casting priest. The tsunami moves at a rate of 24 (240 yards per round) and lasts one round at 14th level, two rounds at 18th level, or three rounds at 22nd or higher level.\n\nShips caught by the tsunami must make a seaworthiness check (see Table 77 : Ship Types in the DMG) with a penalty equal to the wave’s height in feet. For example, a tsunami created by a 15th-level caster would inflict a –30% penalty to a vessel’s seaworthiness check. If the check is failed, the vessel capsizes and sinks in 1d10 rounds, with the possible loss of those aboard. Human or humanoid swimmers caught in the wave must make a saving throw vs. death magic or be drowned in the wave; any creature in the water in the wave’s path will be carried along as long as it lasts.\n\nIf the priest sent the wave towards the shore, the tsunami loses 5 feet of height for every 20 yards it travels; a 30-foot wave could wash 120 yards inland before there was nothing left of it. Creatures caught in the area sustain 1d4 points of damage for every 5 feet of height the tsunami currently possesses and are carried along until it ends. Air-breathing creatures must make saving throws vs. death magic or be drowned outright by this treatment. Wooden buildings have a chance equal to three times the wave’s current height of being destroyed by the tsunami (90% for a 30-foot wave, for example) while stone buildings have a chance equal to the wave’s height (or 30% for a 30-foot wave). Topography may influence or channel the wave’s advance, so a good-sized hill could stop a tsunami cold, although its seaward face may be denuded of creatures and vegetation by the wave.\n\nNote that this spell in the hands of a high-level character can blanket an awesome amount of territory and literally destroy or drown anything in its path. The tsunami is so strenuous a spell that the priest is exhausted and helpless for 1d6 hours after summoning it.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for druids (PO:SM)."

The spell does not affect giant animals and it does not work on creatures of low (i.e., 5) Intelligence or higher. If the creature is within range, the priest, using some type of food desirable to the animal as a lure, can call the animal to come. The animal is allowed a saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is failed, the animal advances toward the priest and awaits his bidding. The priest can communicate with the animal in a crude fashion, telling it to go to a certain place, but directions must be simple. The spellcaster can attach some small item or note to the animal. If so instructed, the animal will then wait at that location until the duration of the spell expires. (Note that unless the intended recipient of a message is expecting a messenger in the form of a small animal or bird, the carrier may be ignored.) When the spell's duration expires, the animal or bird returns to its normal activities. The intended recipient of a message gains no communication ability.\n\nNotes: Common for druids (PHB)."

In either case, the effect kills/destroys the target instantaneously unless it makes a successful saving throw versus death magic at a -4 penalty.\n\nThe priest can affect one creature per round with this spell. After each round, the priest must make a Constitution check. If this fails, the priest is overwhelmed with the effort of sustaining the spell, at which time the spell terminates, leaving the priest fatigued (the equivalent of being stunned) for 1d4 rounds. The maximum possible duration of the spell is 3 turns.\n\nNotes: Common quest spell."

Magical items dysfunction because the fabric of magical reality is changed.\n\nIn the Thought variation, the thoughts of the victims of the spell are distorted and altered so that they find themselves unable to function coherently and effectively. Magical items dysfunction because the thoughts of their users are warped to either convince them that the items cannot function or block thought so that proper commands cannot be given.\n\nThe effects on the victims of the spell are the same for both variations. Each round, there is a 50% chance that a degeneration effect will occur in the area of effect. When this occurs, two events take place. First, spellcasters lose one spell from each level of spell currently memorized (e.g., a spellcaster who has memorized three spells each from levels 1 through 3 loses one spell from each level for a total of three).

        "Priest's Spell Compendium Text": "This potent spell affects all creatures hostile to the priest within the area of effect. The Power granting the spell causes the spell's effects to manifest in one of two ways: the Chaos variation or the Thought variation.\n\nChaos: In the Chaos variation, the fabric of reality is altered to change events. Magical items become dysfunctional because the fabric of magical reality is changed.\n\nThought: In the Thought variation, the thoughts of those affected by the spell are distorted and altered so that they are unable to function coherently and effectively. Magical items become dysfunctional because the thoughts of their users are warped to either convince them that the items cannot function or block thought so that proper commands cannot be given.\n\nThe effects are the same for both variations. Each round, there is a 50% chance that a degeneration effect will occur in the area of effect. When this occurs, two events take place. First, spellcasters lose one spell from each level of spells currently memorized (for example, a spellcaster who has memorized three spells each from 1st through 3rd level loses one spell from each level for a total of three lost spells). Lost spells can be regained normally through rest and memorization.\n\nSecond, magical items are affected in the following ways:\n\n\n * Weapons and armor lose one level of enchantment (a sword +3 becomes a sword +2, and so on).\n * Magical items with charges (wands, rods, staves, etc.) are drained of 1d10 charges.\n * Magical items without pluses or charges must make a saving throw vs. spell (using the saving throw of their owner) or become nonmagical.\n * Potions lose all magic and each scroll loses one randomly determined spell.\n * Permanent magical items (swords, boots, armor, and so on) temporarily lose all special effects until the spell expires or until the items leave the area of effect and for 1d10 rounds thereafter.\n * Single-use and charged items are permanently affected by this spell. For example, a potion destroyed by this spell remains useless even after the spell ends.\n\nWithin the area of effect, magical communication is impossible due to thought blocks and chaotic effects. A reverse of the tongues spell operates continuously in the area of effect. Telepathic communication (for example, with a familiar) is also impossible. No communication magic functions (ESP, sending, and so on); any spellcaster trying to cast such a spell is stunned for 1 round per level of the spell attempted.\n\nIn the Chaos variation of the spell, the center of the area of effect moves 10 feet per round. The direction is randomly determined using 1d8 roll and compass points (I = N, 2 = NE, 3 = E, 4 = SE, 5 = S, 6 = SW, 7 = W, 8 NW). The radius of the spell effect always includes the caster; reroll any contrary result.\n\nNotes: Common quest spell."

Fortify may be used to prepare an open outdoors area such as a field, road, or grassland, or a rough or broken outdoors area such as a hillside, forest, or boulder-fall. Large rooms or chambers such as a cavern or a great hall may be fortified as well. The exact effects of the spell depend on the nature of the site to be fortified.\n\nA. Open Outdoors Site: A rampart or dike of earth and loose stone rises from the ground along the perimeter of the site, leaving a shallow ditch on the outward face. Creatures defending the dike receive 50% cover against missile fire (+4 bonus to AC), or 25% cover (+2 bonus) if they expose themselves by engaging in melee combat or firing missiles out of the dike. Attackers cannot charge, run, or sprint over the ditch-and-dike. Large, open rooms or chambers with few features may fall into this category.\n\nB. Rough Outdoors Site: Loose stones and boulders, deadwood, and patches of dense briars are arranged to form a defensible wall or rampart along the perimeter of the area of effect. Characters hiding behind the wall receive 75% cover (+7 bonus to AC), or 50% cover if they expose themselves by firing missiles or defending the wall. In hand-to-hand combat, the wall’s defenders receive a +1 bonus to attack rolls; man-sized attackers must spend one full round in climbing over the wall in order to enter the fortified area. Natural caverns and large, cluttered chambers fall into this category, as well.\n\nC. Marshy or Low-lying Site: In areas such as swamp, marsh, bog, or tundra, fortify cannot raise a wall or dike to cover the defenders. Instead, the spell creates a water-filled ditch around the perimeter of the area of effect. This ditch is 10 feet wide and 2 to 4 feet deep; most creatures require 1 full round to negotiate the ditch, and defenders gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against enemies who are wading the ditch or climbing up the other side.\n\nThe fortifications are permanent, although erosion, weathering, and excavations, clearing, or filling can quickly raze the site, returning it to its original state. The material component is the shell of a snail dusted with 100 gold pieces worth of diamond powder. In Battlesystem® rules, fortify provides a defending unit with a +2 bonus to its AR against missile and melee attacks, but no bonus against missile attacks in marshy or low-lying areas.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with access to the sphere of War."

The most stringent restriction to this is that the caster must be of good alignment or a druid. Evil or nondruid neutral priests cannot summon a phoenix.\n\nWhen cast, a phoenix will always come to aid. However, depending on how far away the nearest phoenix is, it may take some time for it to appear. One of these powerful creatures will appear in 1d8 – 1 rounds. A modified roll of ‘0' indicates that a phoenix will appear right away in a huge burst of smoke and flame.\n\nBecause the caster must be good or be a druid, there is seldom a conflict of interest between the phoenix and the summoner. However, a phoenix will never attack beings of good alignment (unless there is an extremely good reason for it). It will, however, risk its own life if the cause mandates such action and will further the aims of good that the summoner has undertaken.\n\nWhen the spell has expired, the phoenix does not disappear, but it is then free to do what it will. This may in fact be what the caster summoned it for, or it may leave if it feels the reasons for its summoning were insufficient.\n\nThe material components for this spell are three diamonds of at least 500 gp value (which are consumed by the energies of the spell) and a red hot coal.\n\nNotes: Restricted to priests of good alignment and druids."

The winds of the storm will put out all normal fires within it. Also, any items within the storm must make item saving throws each round or be destroyed-all sandstorm saves are as if versus acid with a +5 bonus. The storm can hold a gas cloud or a creature in gaseous form at bay or push it away from the caster. The cloud obscures vision through it, and creatures are blinded for 1d4 rounds after emerging from it (save versus spell to avoid blindness). A spellcaster caught within the= sandstorm loses concentration and any spells he is about to cast are ruined.\n\nThe material component for this spell is a small bottle of air collected on a windy day.\n\nNotes: Common for priests from the Dark Sun setting; otherwise, very rare."

Before casting the spell, the ranger must spend at least an hour carving a humanoid face in the trunk; if the ranger has a proficiency in wood carving (a variation of artistic ability), he can carve a suitable face in one turn.\n\nAfter carving the face, the ranger spends 1 turn casting the spell, at which time the face becomes animated, twitching and grimacing as if just awakening from a long sleep. The tree face then looks at the caster expectantly, waiting for a question. The caster may ask the tree any single question that can be answered in a single word or short phrase. Typical questions might include: \"Has a dragon passed this way within the last few days?\" \"Has it rained here recently?\" \"Are there any fruit trees nearby?\" The tree answers the question honestly. If the question is beyond the scope of its knowledge, the tree says, \"I don't know.\" After answering, the face disappears.\n\nThe DM should keep in mind that a typical tree doesn't know very much, as it has little experience, never travels, and rarely interacts with other living things in meaningful ways. As a rule of thumb, a tree's knowledge is limited to things it has observed (passersby, weather conditions) and general information about the immediate area (animal populations, location of landmarks). A tree can't give dependable advice or make judgements.

Note that the ebony hand does not enhance attacks with weapons or other ranged spells.\n\nThe material component varies from religion to religion, but it is usually a piece of apparel or jewelry which is worn on the caster's hand to help focus the meditation (often a black glove or a simple silver or onyx ring). Regardless of the actual focus employed, the material component is not consumed by the spell and may be employed in multiple castings. As the spell description implies, the ebony hand may only be granted by malevolent deities to their evil priests.\n\nNotes: Restricted to evil priests, including necromancer-priests."

For instance, the heartbeat of a frail old wizard would be much softer and weaker than that of the invisible ogre bodyguard, standing behind him. This spell can provide quite confusing results if cast in the presence of numerous individuals (such as on a crowded city street) and is most effective when cast by a cleric in relative seclusion. A priest never hears his or her own heartbeat with this spell. It is effectively masked out by the power of the hear heartbeat spell.\n\nObviously, this spell is of little use with creatures without functioning hearts (such as plants or undead). The spell's range is diminished if more than a one-inch thickness of wood, stone, or metal lies between the caster and a subject. Each inch of a barrier's thickness should be treated as 10' of open space.\n\nThe material component is beeswax mixed with a tiny drop of the priest's own blood (to block the sound of his or her own heartbeat). While casting the spell, the priest places the wax in his ears to blot out normal sound and trigger the magical effect.

The (presumably unwilling) spirit of the deceased is entitled to a saving throw vs. spells to resist the effect (made as if still alive), modified by a –1 penalty for every three levels of experience past the 1st of the priest (–2 penalty at 7th level, –3 at 10th level, to a maximum of –6 at 19th level).\n\nSpirit bind must be cast on the body of the deceased within one round of the individuals' death, for every level of experience of the caster. Thus a 10th-level priest may bind the spirit of an individual who was dead for up to a turn. If successful, the spirit bound corpse takes on a pale silvery or mauve radiance. Normal animals and even monsters of low intelligence will involuntarily shun this necromantic aura.\n\nWhile under the effect of this spell, a cadaver becomes immune to the normal effects of rot and decay. Spirit bind may thus be employed to preserve a body for a subsequent raising or resurrection, for which the spirit bound individual is considered to have been dead for less than a day. Furthermore, because of the strong, necromantic link already forged between the spirit and the body, the victim receives a –10% bonus on his or her system shock roll.\n\nHowever, this spell is more often put to much darker ends by death priests. Note that, for the deceased, being spirit bound is not a pleasant experience. The spirit may not be aware of its current location or the passage of time (or so good-aligned priests who employ this spell may like to think), but it is most certainly aware of being trapped or constrained. Once bound to its body, a spirit is much easier to coerce with threats of permanent imprisonment and to interrogate with speak with dead spells. Some sages speculate spirit bind may be also involved in the loathsome creation of a flesh golem.\n\nWhile immune to normal decay and dissolution (and the ravaging of animals and dumb monsters), the spirit bound corpse is in no way protected from destruction by a sentient creature or individual. Should its body be destroyed, the spirit instead becomes bound to the last area resided by the physical remains. Such a restless, quasi-liberated spirit might become a non-corporeal undead (such as an apparition, banshee, haunt, poltergeist, wraith, ghost, or spectre). A spirit imprisoned in this manner may only be released by casting the reverse of this spell (see below) or dispel evil (dispel magic and reverse curse are ineffective). Because of the considerable dangers for the subject and moral quandaries involved, good-aligned priests are naturally reluctant to employ spirit bind except in the most dire emergencies.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, spirit release, severs a spirit's ties with the material world and is a common practice at formal funerals. Unwilling, non-corporeal undead are entitled to a saving throw to resist the spell's effects, subject to the same penalties as outlined for spirit bind. If failed, the undead spirit departs for the outer planes and is effectively dispersed. Note that neither version of this spell affects corporeal undead (such as ghouls, liches, and vampires), nor do they affect extraplanar creatures.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for necromancer-priests."

A death priest, for instance, might inflict a victim with an exaggerated fear of dying (requiring the character to make a saving throw vs. paralyzation to avoid the effects of a fear spell whenever he or she encounters a cadaver, human bones, a graveyard, or even an open coffin). Alternatively, the victim might become convinced that all corpses were undead, waiting to rip him or her to shreds. In a combat situation, a death priest will probably choose to quickly neutralize an opponent with an incapacitating form of insanity, such as confusion or Feeblemindedness. The insanity is permanent and cannot be dispelled except by casting cure insanity (the reverse), heal, restoration, or wish.\n\nThe reverse of this spell immediately cures insanity due to most causes (no saving throw). The spell must be administered while the patient is exhibiting insane symptoms. Cure insanity can heal a conscious victim of the effects of hallucinatory spores and repair psychic trauma (resulting from a mindwipe or other psionic assault). The spell also diminishes psychic exhaustion (restoring 5–40 PSPs). It cures madness resulting from spells (such as confusion, chaos, contact other plane, feeblemind, symbol of insanity, and prismatic spray, wall, or sphere) and also heals the insanity caused by certain magical items (such as an elixir of madness or a scarab of insanity). However, the spell will not control aberrant behaviors caused by lycanthropy, undeath, or powerful curses (such as a geas or quest). Finally, at the DM's discretion, cure insanity may temporarily calm the demented behavior of certain extraplanar creatures (such as slaad)."

After casting the spell, the priest must focus his or her entire concentration on the victim's heart for three rounds, during which time the caster may not cast other spells or engage in melee. The priest may, however, walk, talk, and take ordinary defensive precautions while the spell runs its course through the victim.\n\nDuring the first round of the spell, the victim must make a saving throw vs. death magic with a –2 penalty. This saving throw is modified according to the victim's hit point adjustment due to Constitution (+1 bonus for 15 Con, +2 for 16 Con, and so on; see page 15 in the (PHB) for more on this).\n\nIf the victim makes this first saving throw, the spell fails to take hold of his or her heart and has no further effect. If the victim fails the save, however, then he or she suffers a massive spasm of pain in the chest (similar to that felt in a heart attack), inflicting 1–8 points of damage on the victim and completely incapacitating the individual for one excruciating round.\n\nDuring the second round, the victim is entitled to another saving throw, this time with a –1 penalty (plus any bonuses for Con). As before, if the victim makes the save, the spell ends with no further effect. If failed, however, the victim's chest pain intensifies, as if a searing band of iron were being slowly tightened around the heart. The character experiences severe dizziness, disorientation, and terrible shooting pains in the arms, jaw, and left shoulder.\n\nMeanwhile, the victim loses 25% of any remaining hit points, is paralyzed with pain for 2–5 rounds, and immediately loses 2–5 points of Strength, Constitution, and Dexterity. Providing the victim survives the final stage of the spell (see below), these lost points are regained at a rate of 1 point in each these three ability scores per day.\n\nOn the third round of the spell, the target must make a (third, unmodified) saving throw vs. death magic or suffer a massive heart attack, resulting in immediate death (onset time is 1 round, during which time, the victim is completely incapacitated). Alternatively, a kind DM might decide that the final phase of the spell merely plunges the victim into a deep, death-like coma, lasting 1–4 days and resulting in the permanent loss of 1 point of Constitution.\n\nThis deadly spell may be thwarted in a number of ways. Successfully casting dispel magic on either the victim or the priest will disrupt the heart blight, as will casting a simple protection from evil spell on the victim or wearing a scarab of protection (this drains a charge, however). Furthermore, the victim may be entitled to repeat a saving throw with a +2 bonus if treated by another character with the healing non-weapon proficiency. Finally, the spell is immediately broken if the victim is transported out of range or removed from the priest's line of sight. Because of its murderous effect, this spell is only granted to wicked priests by the gods of Death, Disease, and Evil.\n\nNotes: Common for evil necromancer-priests."

In many cases, the carrier will be oblivious to his cursed condition—especially if the carrier is a frequent traveler and does not remain in a single location long enough for the plague symptoms to surface in those he or she contacts.\n\nThe carrier of a plague curse displays no outward signs of disease and radiates only a very faint aura of necromancy (only a 5% chance of detecting per level). The curse may only be removed from an individual by a priest of higher level than the caster (dispel magic has no effect); alternatively, a cursed object may be cleansed by destruction in fire.\n\nNormally, the curse only expires after it has claimed one life for each level of the original caster. As for the deadly affliction caused by a plague curse, it may be successfully treated with a paladin's healing touch or with such spells as cure disease, heal, or restoration.\n\nThe secrets of this malignant incantation are known only to the scant few priests who serve the cold gods of Pestilence and Decay. It is rumored that some Plague Priests must willingly accept this curse for their religion. Invoking a plague curse ages the caster by one year.\n\nThe material component is the priest's unholy symbol and a small ball of myrrh.\n\nNotes: Rare for evil necromancer-priests."

Attack rolls are similarly decreased by 3. The agonizing symptoms persist until a victim receives a cure disease, heal, or restoration spell bestowed by a more powerful priest than the original caster. Dispel magic and remove curse are powerless to mediate the symptoms of a scourge, but a wish will eradicate the infection immediately.\n\nA scourge may also lead to a long-term, debilitating illness. Those ignoring the malignant disease resulting from the spell's effects for more than a few days may be susceptible to much worse afflictions (such as gangrene, plague, or leprosy) that ultimately result in the victim's untimely death within 1–4 weeks.\n\nFurthermore, if a victim of the spell enters an area of dense population, there is always a chance that the disease may spread (1% per caster level) into an epidemic of massive proportions. These long-term effects of the scourge are left to the discretion of the DM.\n\nThe material component is a specially prepared, black whip or riding crop, which is cracked in the direction of the intended victims during the casting of the spell. Because of its horrific affect, scourge is typically only granted to high priests of a malignant and evil god who is dedicated to spreading death and disease.\n\nNotes: Restricted to necromancer-clerics and evil priests, common for them."

More powerful, intelligent undead may attempt to parley with the priest, but they will invariably end the conversation and attack once their initial curiosity has been satisfied. A priest must be prepared to command, cajole, entice, or destroy whatever creature has been called into his service.\n\nWhenever possible, the DM should choose what kind of undead answers the priest's summoning, based on the caster's current surroundings, level of ability, and alignment. Alternatively, the DM may roll a d20 and consult the following table:\n\nSpecial undead might include sons of Kyuss, apparitions, crypt things, eyes of fear and flame, and any other unusual undead creature the DM may wish to introduce. In truly rare circumstances (for instance, if the spell is cast near a creature's lair), this spell might attract the attention of a more powerful undead, such as a death knight, vampire, or even a lich. These beings will seldom arrive in a predictable fashion and are the most likely to demand some form of nasty retribution or lavish sacrifice to appease.\n\nThe summoned undead remain in the vicinity of the priest for at least one turn per level and may be commanded to assist the priest in his or her endeavors (including, possibly, attacking the caster's opponents). Unless fortified with resist turning, the undead summoned by this spell can be turned (or commanded) by priests other than the caster.

This necromancy induces a victim's throat to constrict and his or her lungs to swell shut, similar to a severe allergic reaction, for so long as the subject remains within range of the spell.\n\nEach round, a victim must attempt a Constitution check. If failed, the victim suffers 1–6 points of damage. If successful, the subject manages to gasp in enough air to reduce the damage to 1–3 points. During its struggles against asphyxiation, the affected creature becomes effectively slowed (as per the 3rd-level wizard spell). A victim who fails three consecutive Constitution checks has been smothered and dies automatically on the following round.\n\nThe effects of asphyxiate continue until either the spell expires, a victim withdraws beyond range of the spell, or a successful dispel magic is employed on a victim. Victims remain slowed for 1–3 rounds after the spell ends. This spell normally affects only humans or demihumans, though the DM may extend the dominion of the spell to include man-sized or smaller animals and monsters. Obviously, creatures (such as undead and plant creatures) that never breathe cannot be affected by this spell.\n\nThe material component is an unholy symbol and a (symbolic) silken gag, which the priest loosely wraps around his or her own mouth after casting the spell.

A death pact is triggered whenever the protected individual is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points (mortally wounded) due to combat, spell, or accident. In the same round, the subject receives the following benefits:\n * The individual (or his or her remains) and all possessions are transported immediately back to a religious sanctuary as if by a word of recall (the location of the sanctuary must be specified at the time of forging the death pact).\n * Upon arrival, the individual receives a raise dead spell (if necessary) and automatically makes any required system shock roll.\n * Any physical damage sustained by the individual is completely healed except for 2–5 (1d4+1) points of damage.\n * Any severed or amputated limbs are instantaneously regenerated.\n * The body is cleared of lingering enchantments with a dispel magic (bestowed at caster's level), whether beneficial or baneful, and cleansed of all poisons, diseases, blindness, curses, and insanity.\n\nA death pact will remain in effect indefinitely until the conditions established at the time of its forging have been fulfilled. The pact may be established to benefit an individual other than the caster. However, in almost all cases, the chosen one must be in good standing with the caster's religion and agree to undertake a mission that will directly benefit the deity or dark power responsible for granting the spell. A dispel magic cannot end a death pact prematurely.\n\nThis powerful spell is not without its costs, however. Forging a death pact is an exhaustively stressful process, drawing the priest into draining audiences with extraplanar powers. As a result, establishing a death pact ages the caster five years and requires at least one week for complete recuperation, during which time the priest cannot cast any spells or engage in any physically demanding activity. Furthermore, when the pact is invoked, the mystical transport and instantaneous healing exacts another toll, this time aging the recipient for five years (if the individual was raised, he or she also loses one point of Constitution permanently). Thus, if the priest casts the spell on him- or herself, he or she must be prepared to sacrifice at least ten years of life!\n\nThe spell's material components are an (un)holy sanctuary consecrated to the caster's deity and seven drops each of the caster's blood, the recipient's blood, (un)holy water, and dew. This powerful pact has enabled many “slain” priests to return from the dead and eliminate their enemies. Wicked necromancers in the service of evil deities are rumored to have significantly reduced the terrible personal toll on the caster by some unspeakably foul sacrifice. Note that powerful wizard necromancers might achieve a similar effect with wish-fortified contingency spells.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for evil necromancer priests; otherwise very rare."

The spell lasts one round per level of the caster; each round, the caster can determine the faction of one creature within range. Most faction members don't bother to hide their affiliation, but on occasion faction's order covert missions or infiltration of other groups. If a creature is trying to conceal its faction, the DM secretly rolls a saving throw vs. spell for the creature. Success means that the creature has foiled the priest's efforts to reveal its true faction affiliation. (For role-playing purposes, the DM makes the roll so that the creature doesn't know if its true faction's been detected or not.) Note that Anarchists posing as members of other factions aren't detected by this spell, as they take their assumed roles to heart.\n\nThis spell is virtually unknown outside of Sigil. It obviously has no effect on creatures without faction affiliation. It doesn't work on those belonging to factions or sects of which the caster has no knowledge. On occasion, however, creatures with deep-rooted philosophical beliefs may be incorrectly identified as faction members this spell. For example, a high-level priest who worships a power of death may be mistaken for a Dustman.\n\nNotes: Rare for planar priests. Unlikely to be learned except by visiting the Outer Planes."

The subject of the spell must be a planar creature or being. Protection from prime does not function at all on the Prime Material Plane.\n\nIn effect, this spell is a version of the protection from evil spell. As such, it has three major effects:\n\nFirst, all attacks made by beings from the Prime Material Plane against the protected creature suffer -2 penalties to attack rolls; any saving throws necessitated by such attacks are made with +2 bonuses.\n\nSecond, any attempt to possess (as by a magic jar attack) or to exercise mental control over the protected creature (as by a vampire's charm ability) is blocked by this spell. Note that the protection does not prevent the vampire's charm itself, but it does prevent the exercise of mental control through the barrier. Likewise, a possessing life force is merely kept out. It would not be expelled if in place before the protection is cast.\n\nThird, the spell prevents direct bodily contact by creatures from the Prime Material Plane. This causes the natural (body) weapon attacks of such beings to fail and the beings to recoil, if such attacks require touching the protected being. Animals or monsters summoned from the Prime Material Plane are likewise hedged from the character.\n\nThis third protection ends if the protected character makes a melee attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked being.

Dictate allows the caster to speak a short, precise phrase or order of no more than a dozen words that must be obeyed by all targets who fail their saving throw. Examples include, \"Throw down your weapons,\" \"Stay here until I return,\" or \"Seize that elf.\" The command must be stated in a language understood by the targets, or the spell fails.\n\nDictate must be phrased to create an immediate course of physical action for the target. Commands to \"die\" or \"sleep\" usually don't work, but commands to \"lie down and put your hands behind your head\" prove effective. If the caster phrases the dictate spell poorly, the DM can assign a saving throw modifier of +1 to +4 for the targets. If the caster directs the intended victim to take an obviously self-destructive action (\"Throw yourself off that cliff or \"Kill yourself) the victim who fails his save stands still for one round, fighting the compulsion to obey. Such commands never work, however. Once an order takes effect, the creature continues following it until it fulfills the condition or the spell's duration ends. Therefore, when a creature ordered to \"climb the ladder\" reaches to top of the ladder, the spell ends. A creature ordered to \"wait here\" does so for the entire duration.\n\nThis spell was developed by and for the Harmonium. Since Harmonium security is very tight and very effective, non-Harmonium priests have little chance to gain access to this spell.\n\nNotes: Common for Harmonium priests.

Blessed forgetfulness negates the injurious effects of failed fear or horror checks, and removes any madness suffered from contact with the howling winds of Pandemonium or the terrors of the Abyss. It does not cure the effects of magically induced insanity or feeblemind, however.\n\nThe material component is a few drops of holy water, sprinkled on the recipient.\n\nThe reverse form, winged memory, restores the memories of any creature affected by the rivers Lethe or Styx. It also restores memories lost to forget or touch of the Styx spells. If used on a spell-casting creature with no memory loss, it restores a single, previously cast spell of 1st or 2nd level to the recipient's mind. The priest cannot use this effect on himself. The material component is the same as for the other form of the spell\n\nNotes: Rare for planar priests. Unlikely to be learned except by visiting the Outer Planes."

        "Introduction": "A group of planewalker priests, tired of depending on their wizard companions for spells that allowed them to breathe on the Elemental Planes, devised this considerably more useful spell. Rather than cast a specific spell for each element that inhibited breathing, they petitioned their powers for a single spell that would allow breathing on any Elemental Plane.\n\nBreath of the elements enables the recipient to breathe freely in a single element for the duration of the spell. At the time of casting, the priest names the appropriate element — fire, salt, ash, earth, and so forth. The ability to breathe in one element doesn't grant the ability to breathe in a similar one, so a body traveling from the plane of Fire to the plane of Magma must recast the spell and \"attune\" it to Magma. Like water breathing, this spell transforms the element into a breathable atmosphere for the spell's recipient. Since the planes of Vacuum, Positive Energy, and Negative Energy have no such atmosphere to transform, the spell is ineffectual on those planes.\n\nThe priest can divide the base duration of the spell between multiple characters, to a minimum of one half-hour per recipient.\n\nNotes: Rare spell, unlikely to be known by priests without plane-traveling experience."

The subject of the spell must be a planar creature or being. Protection from prime does not function at all on the Prime Material Plane. In effect, this spell is a version of the protection from evil, 10' spell. As such, it has three major effects:\n\nFirst, all attacks made by beings from the Prime Material Plane against the protected creatures suffer -2 penalties to attack rolls; any saving throws necessitated by such attacks are made with +2 bonuses.\n\nSecond, any attempt to possess (as by a magic jar attack) or to exercise mental control over a protected creature is blocked by this spell. Likewise, a possessing life force is merely kept out. It would not be expelled if in place before the protection is cast.\n\nThird, the spell prevents direct bodily contact by creatures from the Prime Material Plane. This causes the natural (body) weapon attacks of such beings to fail and the beings to recoil, if such attacks require touching the protected being. Animals or monsters summoned from the Prime Material Plane are likewise hedged out.\n\nThis third protection ends if the protected individuals make a melee attack against a blocked being or the recipient tries to force the barrier against the blocked being. The penalty applied to attacks from Prime-Material beings presented as the first spell effect remains active in any event, however.\n\nTo complete this spell, the priest must trace a 10-foot-diameter circle on the floor (or ground) with the powdered bone of a Prime-Material creature.\n\nNotes: Rare for planar priests.

The priest casting elemental protection renders one creature immune to the effects of one specific type of element (chosen by the priest at the time of casting) for the duration of the spell. The level of protection is determined by the type of damage the creature suffers. For purposes of this spell, there are two types of damage: passive and active.\n\nPassive damage is environmental damage. Passive fire damage is from heat from nearby fires or burns from falling into a fire pit. The fire is not wielded with intent to do damage. The recipient of the spell is completely immune to this type of damage.\n\nActive damage is the result of an attack. A red dragon's breath, fireball spells, boiling oil poured from the top of a wall, fire elemental strikes, and similar attacks are active fire damage. The recipient of the spell suffers only 50% of the damage inflicted by such attacks. All saving throws made by the subject gain a +4 bonus to the die roll.\n\nThis spell was developed by a planewalker priest who frequented the Elemental Planes, but it has also come into use by planewalkers visiting dangerous areas on the Great Ring - the icy layer of Stygia on Baator or the fiery layer of Muspelheim on Ysgard, for example. Although protection from fire is a fine spell, elemental protection is much longer-lasting and, over all, more effective. (Note that this spell does not provide the ability to breathe easily on the plane, however.)\n\nThe material component is the caster's holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for planar priests; otherwise, virtually unknown."

This elemental material becomes a permanent pocket. The breach stays open for a considerable amount of time, allowing passage through it in either direction.\n\nThe breach is an uneven tear, with the elemental material of the other plane easily visible through it. The size of the breach is approximately a 10-foot by 10-foot square per level of the caster, so it is possible to create large holes. The elemental material comes through the breach in a manner and rate as determined by the DM, but it should be fairly constant and consistent with the size of the breach and the nature of the intruding material. Although the material becomes an elemental pocket, at the breach itself the two elements interact, possibly forming dangerous conditions (fire and water produce huge amounts of burning steam, for example).\n\nThe spell creates habitable areas within the Elemental Planes, such as an island of earth on the plane of Water, or a pocket of air on the plane of Smoke. Many spellcasters choose to make their homes or temples in such unique and exotic places.\n\nTearing holes in the metaphysical barriers between planes does not occur without gaining the attention of a high-up elemental being, perhaps even a true power. This being can reside on either side of the breach. There is a 25% chance that a being of power will be alerted and annoyed enough to send minions to close the breach (and possibly punish the offending priest). The DM may determine the nature of these minions. This chance is cumulative for every time a priest opens a breach into or out of the being's plane in a given year. Obviously, if the priest opens the breach specifically to undermine or harm the being, his realm, or his minions, intervention is automatic.\n\nThe material components for the spell are samples of the two planes' elemental material, or silver symbols signifying such (material from the planes of Radiance or Negative Energy, for example, is difficult to store).\n\nNotes: Common for priests from the Elemental Planes, uncommon for other planar priests; otherwise virtually unknown."

The effect is centered on the caster and moves with him, spreading outward with a radius of 1/2 mile per caster level.\n\nIf a being who means harm to the caster (or his group) comes within the area of an active foesight, the caster immediately senses the enemy's presence. After two rounds, the feeling grows in strength, and the caster knows the approximate distance of the foe, the general direction from which it comes, and the speed at which it travels.\n\nThe spell does not in any way identify the enemy or provide information on its strength. It does, however, give the caster a general sense of the foe's numbers (whether it's one berk or an army). Foesight doesn't change based on the distance of the enemy — that is, the caster's sense of danger doesn't increase as the enemy draws closer.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, hidden hatred, protects a body from being detected by foesight until he's within 10 feet of a target. At that distance, hidden hatred can no longer cloak the attacker's enmity. Although foesight works only for the caster of the spell, any creature can be the recipient of a hidden hatred spell.\n\nThe material component of foesight or hidden hatred is the caster's holy (or unholy) symbol.\n\nRumors exist of higher-level variants of both spells that affect more than one person — even whole armies, in some cases.

        "Introduction": "Surelock was specifically designed to protect against unwanted plane-spanning portals. As long as it's in effect, the spell seals all gates and portals that reach into other planes. The spell does not affect movement abilities within a single plane, so a teleport spell is unaffected by it (since it can't take a body to other planes). However, permanent, temporary, and shifting portals cannot open within the area affected by the spell. Likewise, plane shift and astral spell don't function within the area of effect. A gate spell cannot pull a creature into or out of the affected area. Any attempt to use any of these powers results in automatic failure — a spell to that effect would be wasted and a charge from a magical item would be lost.\n\nWhen cast, surelock spreads out in a radius from the caster to the full extent of its area of effect. It is not possible to exclude portals within this area; everything is affected equally. Nor can the effect be lowered, even by the caster, without the use of dispel magic. Once cast, the area does not move — although originally centered on the priest, it does not follow him around thereafter.\n\nDespite the various gate ward and gate seal spells used by wizards, this is still — by far — the most potent ward against interplanar travel. Its radius of effect, duration, and ability to block spells as well as actual gates and portals makes it clearly superior. Despite this, note that in Sigil, the Lady of Pain has absolute control over the city's portals and may choose to overturn the spell's effects at her whim.\n\nThe material component for this spell is a crystal key that must be shattered when the spell is cast.\n\nNotes: Rare for planar priests.

DMs must give specific permission for PCs to have access to these lower-planar dweomers.''\n\nThis powerful offensive spell only affects creatures that have some level of natural magic resistance. Inverted magic turns that protection against them.\n\nWhen the caster touches the intended target, he unleashes - and inverts - the inherent magical power within the creature. The target can attempt a saving throw and a magic resistance roll to avoid the effects. If it fails the save, the creature is racked with painful energy and suffers a percentage of its current hit points in damage equal to its magic resistance. What's more, the sod is stunned for a number of rounds equal to the number of hit points lost divided by 10 (round down). When stunned, a creature can make no attacks, use no spells or magical abilities, and moves at half speed. The stunned creature's opponents receive a +4 bonus to attack rolls.\n\nFor example, a babau (with 5O% magic resistance) fights with a mortal priest until it has only 40 hit points left. The priest then casts inverted magic on the fiend. The babau fails its saving throw and loses 5O% of its remaining hit points, bringing it to 20. In addition, the babau is stunned for two (20 divided by 10) rounds.\n\nAnother example: A black abishai (3O% magic resistance) has 20 hit points left in a scrap with a priest. The priest casts inverted magic on the abishai, which fails its save and loses 30% of its remaining hit points, bringing it to 14. The abishai lost only 6 hit points, so it's not stunned at all (6 divided by 10, rounded down, is less than one).\n\nThe material component for the inverted magic spell is a silver holy (or unholy) symbol worth at least 100 gp. The symbol is consumed by the magic unleashed."

Although spell recipients cannot actually see in the darkness, they are completely aware of all natural and unnatural hazards and creatures that they would be able to perceive in fully illuminated conditions and can react accordingly. The spell does not allow the detection of invisible or magically silenced creatures or hazards. Recipients of this spell suffer no attack penalties for darkness or blindness while under the effects of this spell.\n\nAlthough this spell can only be cast on a single recipient, any living creature in physical contact with the recipient when the spell is cast or part of a chain of creatures in physical contact with each other and with the spell recipient receives the benefit of the dark path as well while contact is maintained.\n\nRelying on such chains of contact is dangerous during combat situations, since the benefit of the spell stops immediately for any creature who loses direct or indirect physical contact with the spell recipient (as well as anyone further down the living chain). Reestablishing contact reestablishes the dark path unless the spell has already ended. Creatures not in contact with the spell recipient (or the chain to the spell recipient) when the spell is cast cannot later join the chain or touch the spell recipient and gain the spell's benefits; such beings also effectively terminate a chain wherever they are positioned, so those linked in a chain after them lose the dark path's benefits also until the chain is rearranged to exclude them.\n\nIf the spell's recipient or anyone in contact with the recipient enters an area of illumination (defined as coming within 15 feet of a lit torch, within an appropriate distance to another light source such as a lamp or lantern, or entering the area of effect of a light or continual light spell), the dark path spell ends immediately, and everyone currently receiving the benefits of the dark path must make a successful saving throw vs. spell or be stunned for 1 round and blinded for 1d6 rounds.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a small piece of luminescent lichen and the priest's holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Ibrandul, the Skulking One, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

        "Introduction": "By means of this spell, a priest creates a magical warning system. When any creature larger than a common honeybee enters a guarded area (a passage, chamber, cavern, doorway, or cave mouth of up to the area of effect), a wailing, whistling blast of wind blows from the guarded area toward the casting priest. The priest designates the area to be protected verbally, and must be standing within 5 yards per level of the area to be protected when the spell is cast.\n\nThe wailing wind travels toward the caster as long as she or he is on the same plane as the guarded area, but fades out beyond 100 yards per level of the casting priest. The wailing wind has a distinctive tone that can be heard by all creatures capable of hearing. It transmits and magnifies any sounds (speech, movement, etc.) made by the triggering being at the time it is activated, and it thus gives any listener a clue as to what sort of intruder approaches.\n\nThe spell cannot be modified to be activated by only specific beings or types of creatures. Once the guarded area is entered and the wailing wind rises, the spell is exhausted unless the caster was of sufficient level to allow another activation of the spell for another intruder. The wind itself lasts for 1 round per level of the casting priest once triggered, although the caster may end it sooner.\n\nA wailing wind can be activated more than once, depending on the level of its caster. As the level of the caster increases, the number of blasts of wailing wind occurring for different intruders at different times is also increased. A 1st- or 2nd-level caster creates only a single-blast wailing wind; a 3rd- or 4th-level caster creates a wind of two blasts; a 5th- or 6th-level caster creates a wind of three blasts, and so on with no known maximum.\n\nNotes: Granted by Eldath, the Green Goddess of the Forgotten Realms setting."

It cannot restore dead plants to life, nor make ravaged plants whole, but it brings what remains to peak condition— wilted flowers bloom anew, and drooping leaves rise up green. Leaves that have fallen to the ground cannot be reattached to their plants by means of this magic, but withered foliage can be made green and growing again even in the depths of winter as long as the spell lasts. In this manner, the skeleton of a hedge can be made opaque with thick growth in an instant. A flower restored by means of this magic can be picked without ending the magic, though it shrivels again when the spell expires.\n\nIf the weather and season permit continued life, restorations wrought by this spell outlive it. For example, a diseased, shriveled plant restored to health will remain healthy, following its normal growing cycle, and not lapse back into ruin the moment the spell ends. To injured mobile or intelligent plant life (such as treants and shambling mounds), application of a banish blight restores 1dlO+4 hit points of damage permanently, but it cannot help healthy plants to grow larger or gain extra hit points.\n\nMielikki crafted this spell both as a gift to Silvanus and to empower her faithful to give forest creatures endless food by restoring half-eaten vegetation to a full state.\n\nNotes: Granted by many nature deities, including Mielikki of the Forgotten Realms setting and the elven god Rillifane Rallathil"

For instance,' cucumbers would burst open a crate or barrel, but tomatoes would explode before such containers gave way. This spell can only affect a plant, vegetable, or piece of fruit once. Further castings are ineffective.\n\nNotes: Granted by Chauntea. the Great Mother, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

The exact effect must be determined by the DM and is in no way controlled by the caster. Favor of Shaundakul only functions in wilderness settings or severe weather conditions while the caster is on a journey. It does not work while the caster is at home, as one's home is considered the end or beginning of a journey, not a point in the midst of one.\n\nTypical effects include finding a safe place to camp, being able to start a fire in wet conditions, finding shelter in a blinding snowstorm, stumbling across an oasis while crossing the desert, finding a rare herb native to the region which cures a particular disease or neutralizes a particular poison, finding a light source while in darkness, etc. This never gives bonuses or penalties to any sort of roll.\n\nThe material component is the caster's holy symbol, which is not consumed in the casting.\n\nNotes: Granted by the god of travel Shaundakul of the Forgotten Realms setting."

The beam lasts until the spell expires, the caster wills the magic to end, or the priest undertakes the casting of another spell.\n\nA frost whip is commonly swung about to lash foes. It can pass through them like a force, rather than a real whip, so that if the caster faces several opponents, it can be swung in an arc through all of them. If held in front of the body or across an opening, it can sometimes be made unavoidable so that foes must take damage from it, but it otherwise attacks once per round at the caster's normal THAC0 for 4d4 points of damage. A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces the damage by half.\n\nA gently applied frost whip can also freeze windows shut, stop pipes, freeze water, ruin fruits and vegetables, and render items fragile or surfaces slippery.\n\nNotes: Granted by Auril Frostmaiden of the Forgotten Realms setting."

Its bite is under the control of the caster; it does not automatically snap at anything it touches. The caster can only deliver the hand's attack by slapping his or her palm against a target, requiring a successful normal attack roll; it can bite once per round.\n\nThe bite of a handfang does 1 point of damage and forces the victim to make two saving throws, one vs. paralyzation and the next vs. spell. If the saving throw vs. paralyzation fails, the victim is paralyzed for Id3 rounds; if it succeeds, this effect is negated. If the saving throw vs. spell fails, the mouth's saliva corrodes the victim, doing 3d4 points of additional damage. If this saving throw succeeds, this damage is reduced to 1d6 points. These twin saving throws must be made against every bite of a handfang; saving successfully against one attack does not mean that the victim is immune to these effects. Paralyzed victims who are not actively protected by compatriots or somehow moved beyond the reach of the spell's caster are automatically successfully attacked by the handfang on subsequent rounds while they are paralyzed if the spellcaster targets them.\n\nNotes: Granted by Moander the Darkbringer of the Forgotten Realms setting."

This wound inflicts a temporary loss of 2 points of Charisma upon the victim, but the wound vanishes and the ability score points are regained through normal healing rest or the use of curative magic (such as cure light wounds).\n\nIf the saving throw fails, the victim suffers 6 points of damage and is slowed (as the spell) instantly until the end of the following round.

If this second saving throw fails, the victim suffers 3d6 points of additional damage and must make a Constitution ability check and a Strength ability check.

The weapon is an intangible line offeree, not an actual cord that can wrap around things, be grasped, or be cut.\n\nA whip of flame does damage by transmitting heat, searing whatever it touches for 1d8+3 points of damage per strike. Metal weapons and armor transmit full damage to their wearers, but leather armor or the padding typically worn under metal armor reduces damage by half, rounding fractions down, for the first strike of the whip of flame; thereafter, such garments are hot enough to transmit full damage to their wearers.\n\nNote that creatures can pass through the lashing whip without being slowed or hampered in any way, but in turn they have no effect on it. Beings who rush through the stretched-out whip or otherwise deliberately come into contact with it take its full damage even when it has already struck another creature on the same round.\n\nThe whip of flame fades away when the spell expires, the caster wills it to, or the caster commences any other spellcasting.\n\nThe material components of the spell are one of the caster's hairs and a flaming branch, spark, or lump of charcoal.\n\nNotes: Granted hy the evil goddess Loviatar of the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting."

The spell recipient may be the caster or another being touched by the caster during casting. The magic bestows temporary but complete familiarity with the use, care, and handling of the weapon and all accouterments. For instance, a wizard temporarily given proficiency in the use of a crossbow knows how to wind or cock it, which nearby implement is the necessary windlass (if it is that type of crossbow), and the different uses and proper loading of a variety of quarrels (if an array is present). Similarly, a scholar suddenly made familiar with a pickaxe would know how to use it to cleave rock along a plane, how to avoid striking sparks, how to strike so as to blunt the tool very quickly or as slowly as possible, what care to give it, and so on.\n\nThis magic does not confer any added Strength, reach, body weight, or other physical adjustments so as to allow the spell recipient to wield the weapon or tool most effectively; it just instills the precise and complete knowledge of how to do so. When the spell ends, this knowledge is forgotten, although memories of particular things done with the weapon or tool remain.\n\nNotes: Granted by the god Gond, Lord of All Smiths, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

In any round in which the wind lash successfully strikes, all target spellcasting that has a castings time of more than 1 is ruined, and the target must make a successful saving throw vs. paralyzation or be hurled to the ground, taking an additional 1 point of damage and forcing all fragile carried items to make a saving throw vs. fall.\n\nThe caster can switch targets at will, but switching targets takes a round, during which time no one can be attacked by the wind lash. The nature of the wind lash is such that only the chosen target is struck. Other beings are aware of the spell because it emits terrifying snarling wind noises and may even blow away small, light objects such as cap-feathers and parchments that are not securely gripped (but they suffer no damage). If the spellcaster casts another spell while this spell is still in effect, the wind lash dissipates immediately.

These jaws deal 2d4 points of damage to all opponents the priest successfully attacks with them. The spell allows the caster to strike with the jaws twice per round and to gain a +1 bonus on all attack rolls with the jaws or another weapon while the spell is in effect. A Wolfjaws spell vanishes if its caster attempts any other spellcasting, but a priest can wield a weapon or trigger a magical item in his or her left hand and use a Wolfjaws, thus gaining multiple attacks normally denied to him or her without affecting the spell in any way.\n\nThe caster can end a Wolfjaws instantly at will. When the spell ends early in this manner, the caster can also spell remove the damage dealt by the last bite of the Wolfjaws, an ability that the priest can use to bargain with a wounded foe or to correct cases where an ally has mistakenly been attacked by the priest. While Wolfjaws is in effect, it provides its caster with complete immunity to all hostile magical or psionic shape change and hold effects.\n\nThe material component for this spell is a bit of wolf fur or a tooth from any type of mammal.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Tyr the Just God of the Forgotten Realms setting."

        "Introduction": "This spell transforms its material component into a temporary weapon: a sword that can be wielded by the caster or be directed to attack a particular target by the caster from afar. In either case, it strikes with the caster's normal THAC0, deals 1 hit point of damage per level of the caster at every successful strike, and vanishes instantly when the spell expires or it comes into contact with any flame. If released to fight on its own, a wood sword is AC —1, has 22 hp, and moves at MV Fl 16 (A). It strikes once per round at a single target.\n\nThe target of a wood sword can be indicated during casting or determined later and can be changed at any time. The caster can choose any visible creature or item within range and silently will the wood sword to attack it. A wood sword hangs motionless if its designated target dies or vanishes if not given a new target. The caster can bid the weapon go and attack a certain target or return to be directly wielded as often as desired during the life of the spell.\n\nA wood sword is supple, but can be broken by successful edged weapon chopping attacks that do more damage than it has hit points or by being caught in a closing stone or metal door; such destruction ends the spell instantly. The caster can fight with another weapon and leave the wood sword to fight on its own, but if its creator casts any other spell, the wood sword vanishes the instant that new magic takes effect. Caster use of magical items does not destroy a wood sword.\n\nA wood sword can do no harm to nonliving wood or to stone or metal, but can readily be employed to smash glass flasks, topple items, and even to stir mixtures in distant bowls. (A clever caster could direct it to knock over the rearmost bottle in a cluster of glass objects, thereby making it smash or knock over the other glass objects in its way.) If the caster has the leisure to enact precise control, a wood sword can perform quite delicate tasks. It need not merely attack things. If used to carry things (such as satchels or ropes across chasms, or rings of keys to prisoners), it breaks if burdened with a greater weight than the caster can lift (the caster's maximum press amount, dictated by his or her Strength ability score).\n\nThe material component of this spell is a twig, branch, or any fragment of wood that still retains some bark and has not been cut, stained, varnished, or otherwise altered by tools. (This means the wood must be picked up as fallen wood or snapped off rather than cut.)\n\nNotes: Granted by the nature gods Mielikki and Gwaeron Windstrom of the Forgotten Realms setting."

The animated quill writes as fast as the caster can and copies as much of any writing the caster assigns it to copy as can be duplicated before the spell expires. The quill vanishes when the spell is done or earlier if the caster wills the magic to end.\n\nThough the ink created by amanuensis is unique and does not duplicate the copied work, the penmanship of the copy is exacting. Perfect forgeries can be made by means of this spell.\n\nOnce the quill is set to its task, the caster need not be present or in range for it to continue; only destruction of the writing surface or the casting of dispel magic upon the quill prevents the writing from being completed. If necessary to complete its assigned task, the quill becomes intangible and follows the writing surface if it is moved; it cannot be grasped or struck aside in an effort to make it cease. No being except the caster can control or influence the moving quill. If the quill finishes its copying and some time remains before the spell ends, the caster must be within range, however, to direct it to begin copying a second writing or making a second copy of the same writing.\n\nAn amanuensis spell cannot copy any magical writing or markings. If directed to do so, the quill hangs motionless. A diary, grimoire, or other work containing passages of text interspersed with spells and magical symbols is copied as text with gaps where the original displays magical markings. Many powerful priests have pleaded with Deneir to allow this spell to be modified so that their prayers would allow them to copy spells, but Deneir has steadfastly refused to grant this power.\n\nThe material components of this spell are a quill pen and a blank sheet or sheets of parchment, some vellum scrip, a chapbook, or another writing surface onto which the writing will be copied. The quill is consumed at the end of the spell's duration; the writing surface is not.\n\nNotes: Granted by the god Deneir. Lord of Glyphs, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

Those injuries still deal damage, and death may occur from loss of blood, strangulation, and the like, but dignity and composure can be maintained, shock avoided, and clear, calm thought retained in the face of such horrid occurrences. The spell allows its recipient to die nobly, to stay conscious and calm to pass on vital information, to remain alert and aware as an observer even if dying, and so on. The spell banishes feeblemindedness, shock, delirium, and charm effects, frees the recipient being from hypnotic effects, maze spells, and confusion, and revives him or her from dazed conditions and faints. Pain and physical symptoms will return if their causes are still present when the spell expires, but the helpful effects of favor of Ilmater on the recipient's mind are permanent—for instance, a broken charm is gone forever.\n\nIn the second form of favor of Ilmater, the caster may choose to take on all of the hit point damage suffered by another creature, instantly transferring their own current hit points to the injured being by means of the spell. This switch is permanent until the caster uses normal methods to heal the damage. Beings who receive more hit points than they normally possess in this trade lose the excess. This transfer may be done from a distance so long as the spell range is not exceeded, and neither the priest nor the recipient being need make system shock survival rolls unless the transfer of hit points brings the priest to death and does not bring the injured being up to above zero hit points.

Individuals who succeed at the roll are placed in a coma; they are not dead but are unable to heal without magical aid.\n\nNote that diseases, parasitic infestations, drunkenness, and other conditions cannot be taken on by the caster by means of the second use of a favor of Ilmater spell; only purely physical damage can be transferred. Ilmater regards the taking on of the pain of others in this way to be a very holy act, and encourages his clergy to make such use of this spell whenever a real (not frivolous) need is present.",

Missiles and other weapons and solid objects, including parts of the caster's body, pass through it without impediment. The shield remains attached to one of the caster's hands (chosen during the casting) unless the casting priest touches another creature's hand and wills control of the shield to pass to the other (who must agree to the transfer or it cannot occur).\n\nThe shield works against flame. Its touch extinguishes normal torches, flaming oil, and candles instantly. Larger fires are diminished. A fireball striking or exploding around the bearer of a flame shield, for example, does only half damage. A flame blade coming into contact with a flame shield is harmlessly destroyed. A flame shield fully cancels out a flame strike if held directly in the path of the flame strike (over the shield-bearer's head); this destroys the flame shield instantly. If the flame shield is not held in such a fashion, the shield-bearer takes half damage as for a fireball.\n\nFlame-related illusions, hypnotic patterns, and the like have no effect on any being viewing them through a flame shield. A magical, flaming sword striking through a flame shield encounters no resistance and inflicts normal weapon damage but no flame damage. Any part of such a blade that has passed through the shield remains free of flames while any part of the blade is in contact with the shield; thus a flaming sword striking through a flame shield cannot ignite a scroll or other flammable object by touch.\n\nThe material components for this spell are a piece of phosphorous, a drop of mercury, and a cobweb.\n\nNotes: Granted by nature goddess Eldath of the Forgotten Realms setting."

        "Introduction": "This spell creates a mobile shadow that transmits sounds within 60 feet of its location to its caster (similar to, but by no means exactly like, the wizard spell clairaudience). The locale being listened to need not be known. The shadow need not be man-shaped, but it is always of approximately the same cubic volume as the caster. It can squeeze through any hole that one of the caster's hands, up to the wrist, could pass through, and the caster can change its shape at will. The shadow glides along the ground or floor at MV 15, feather falling gently to earth if it moves over a sudden drop-off. It cannot fly or rise except by moving up a stair, or climbing a wall, rock face, or incline that the caster could traverse.\n\nThe caster can simply send the shadow this spell creates a certain distance in such-and-such a direction and listen at that spot or even let the shadow move for the spell duration and listen as it travels. If creatures being listened to move beyond 60 feet from the heart of the shadow, the priest can move the shadow as many times as desired to try to pick them up again, but the direction and distance moved has to be guesswork unless the priest is situated so as to overlook the shadow.\n\nThe shadow is visible, and will no doubt attract attention if it moves, stops, moves again, and appears to follow beings— especially when no shadow should be present.\n\nThe range of this spell denotes how distant the shadow can be from caster before it dissipates.\n\nAlthough the shadow must initially appear within 300 feet of the caster, both it and the caster can move during the duration of the spell, and the caster can employ other magics without ending the listening shadow. (The caster could teleport away from where the shadow was cast and maintain contact with it so long as his or her new location is still within spell range.)\n\nSome senior priests of Mask have access to powerful magics that allow a listening shadow to teleport to another or even a succession of locales, listening in to each one for a time; certain Maskarran clergy are quite practiced at skipping from one end of a long-range conversation that is being conducted by magical means to another to try to hear most of what is said by all speakers involved. Those who know how can cast a modified tongues spell on a listening shadow (which must be touched directly by the caster at the time) so that although the shadow transmits actual speech and sounds, a simultaneous translation is heard as well in the caster's head alone.\n\nThe presence of lead or gorgon's blood in walls (or their mortar) serves as a barrier against the listening linkage of shadow to caster, but the caster retains control of the spell effect. If the shadow can then be moved to a spot where there is no effective intervening barrier, the sound link is restored. Only sounds that are normally detectable by the caster can be heard by this spell, and it only functions on its caster's current plane of existence.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Mask, god of thieves in the Forgotten Realms setting."

The first creature touched by the caster within six rounds of the casting is infected by brown mold. A successful attack roll is required to touch an opponent in combat or one who is not unaware or immobilized.\n\nIf the caster cannot touch any creature, the mold spores vanish at the end of six rounds.\n\nThe mold spores created by this spell cannot live on plant or inorganic material. All the spores are transferred to the first creature touched by the caster. Thus, the caster can infect only one creature per spell. In the event of an accident, this could well be a friend or ally. A mold touch spell inflicts 4d6 points of damage upon the target creature, and half that if the victim makes a successful saving throw vs. spell.\n\nBrown mold spreads from the contact point rapidly, growing by absorbing body heat. In the process, it chills the victim. In the second round after the attack, the mold inflicts 2d6 points of damage and half that if the victim makes a successful saving throw vs. spell. On every round thereafter, the victim receives a saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is successful, no damage is taken, and the spell ends. If the saving throw is failed, the victim takes 1d6 points of damage in that round.\n\nBrown mold created by this spell is of limited duration, and a victim cannot infect other creatures even if intending to do so. Magical cold harms mold created by this spell in the usual manner, but also affects the creature on which the mold is growing.\n\nThe material components of this spell are mistletoe, holly, or oak leaves.\n\nNotes: Granted by Eldath the Green Goddess of the Forgotten Realms setting."

It cannot be dropped, transferred to the grasp of another being, or broken. To strike, it must be wielded as a weapon.

Its strike drains vitality or life force, causing no visible wounds, but inflicting 1d12+4 points of damage. Undead are visibly wounded by a moon blade; their substance boils away from its touch, and they suffer 2d 12+4 points of damage per blow.\n\nA successful moon blade strike temporarily scrambles magic. On the round after being hit, victims cannot cast spells or call on any spell-like abilities. The functioning of existing spell conditions is suspended for that round, and magical items wielded by the victim do not function for that round.\n\nA moon blade vanishes if its caster is slain or casts any other spell except those that have only verbal components.\n\nThis spell as no connection with the enchanted items known as moonblades borne and made by some elves.\n\nNotes: Granted by the goddess Selune of the Forgotten Realms setting, and the elven goddess Sehanine Moonbow."

So far as any injuries permit, the recipient acts happy, refreshed, rested, high-spirited, and unhurt. While the recipient is enraptured, lures designed to prey upon his or her libido are ignored (such as the song of sirens). Enraptured recipients are not affected by hypnosis or any attempts (magical or psionic) to control or influence their minds (for example, charm person spells).\n\nThe enraptured state can be a mixed blessing. Whenever a being is affected by a rapture spell, it must succeed at a saving throw vs. paralyzation or be so strongly affected as to be stunned for the spell duration. Stunned beings tremble, drop any held items or weapons, and can take no voluntary or deliberate actions until the spell wears off. Rapture affects only intelligent mammals. Priests of Sune may cast rapture on themselves; they receive a +4 bonus to their saving throws to avoid being stunned.\n\nNotes: Granted by Sune, Lady of Love, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

At the end of the debate, the priests then step out onto the water's surface.

If the caster has never seen and worked with a khopesh, she or he could not create a shadow khopesh.) This spell does not confer proficiency in the chosen weapon.\n\nA shadow sword functions in all ways as a magical sword +1 of the selected type. In addition, it functions with a +2 attack and damage bonus against ogres, trolls, goblinkin, giantkin, and giants. It functions with a +3 attack and damage bonus against undead creatures.\n\nIf at any time the casting priest releases the shadow sword (something the casting priest can only do voluntarily) or the shadow sword enters an area of absolute darkness the spell immediately expires. If a light, continual light, continual darkness, or similar spell is cast directly on a shadow sword, both the shadow sword and the cast spell are immediately canceled.\n\nThe somatic component of this spell involves the caster reaching a gauntleted hand into an area of deep shadow and drawing forth the shadow sword. The material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol (a gauntlet) in which the shadow sword must be wielded.

The caster can move the shield by force of will at MV 12 (B) and turn or tilt it as desired, until she or he engages in other spellcasting, whereupon control over the shield is lost, and it remains stationary until the spell expires.\n\nA storm shield is effective from all sides, but it only deflects normal missiles; a sword or other weapon can be thrust through it with no effect on either the shield or the attack.\n\nNotes: Granted by Talos the Destroyer, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

Hurled shards always strike at THAC0 7, regardless of the priest's own attack prowess. They cause Id4 points of damage each, and 1d3 of them fly at the target of a shard attack. The caster designates the target of a shard attack, but has no control over how many shards are hurled at it. The missile range of these shards is 5 (short)/10 (medium)/15 (long) yards, and they may be fired at point blank range at neither a penalty or a bonus.\n\nThe damage and duration of a wheel of bones is unaffected by the number of shards it fires, and the caster of the wheel is never harmed by the spell's bone shards, regardless of where they fly, ricochet, or strike.\n\nThe material components of this spell are at least two bones or bone fragments from any source.\n\nNotes: Granted by Eldath, the Green Goddess of the Forgotten Realms setting."

It strikes opponents up to 10 feet distant.\n\nThe whip of pain functions as a +2 magical weapon for purposes of which creatures it is able to affect. When the wielder successfully strikes a target, the whip makes a loud snapping sound, and the target must make a saving throw vs. spell and a Constitution ability check. If the saving throw fails, the victim suffers 4d4 points of damage; if it succeeds, the victim suffers only half damage. If the ability check succeeds, the target feels only enough pain to suffer a -1 penalty to his or her very next attack roll. If it fails, the target is wracked by pain on the remainder of the current and all of the next round. This lowers his or her Armor Class by 1, places a -2 penalty on attack rolls, and makes it impossible for the victim to concentrate enough to cast any spells.\n\nThe whip of pain fades away when the spell expires, is dispelled, the caster wills it to, the caster falls unconscious, or the caster commences any other spellcasting. The wielder can trigger magical items like wands with his or her other hand without ending this spell.\n\nThe material components of this spell are a drop of unholy water and one of the caster's hairs.\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil goddess Loviatar of the Forgotten Realms setting."

This spell is very unpopular among farmers and ranchers, who see it as a miscarriage of divine intervention.\n * Light: Advanced sunshine can be used to borrow sunlight from later in the day (or the next day if at night) to create light now. This is useful in caverns or at night. This form of the spell is treated as a light spell lasting one turn per level of the caster, but it shortens the day's sunshine by one minute per level.\n * Fireball: A piece of the sun's energy can be converted into a fireball as though cast by a mage of the casting priest's level. This lowers the temperature within a 90-mile radius by 1 degree Fahrenheit for a tenday each time it is cast. This aspect of the spell cannot be cast at night or during cloudy days.\n * Illumination: This version of advanced sunshine can be used to borrow sunlight from later in the day (or the next day if at night) to cast continual light at double the range and effect for the caster's level. This shortens the day's sunshine by one hour.\n\nNotes: Granted by the sun god Amaunator of the Forgotten Realms setting."

Such a spell is readable via a read magic ability conferred with the casting of anyspell, but only one spell can be read and cast for each casting of anyspell. Merely reading the titles of spells on scrolls or in spellbooks to find a desired spell does not exhaust the magic of the anyspell; an entire spell must be read. Once anyspell is cast and a wizard spell is read, the wizard spell is retained in the priest's mind until the priest casts it. Such wizard spells are cast precisely as if by a wizard of the same level as the casting priest, except that the user of an anyspell needs no material components to work the wizard spell.\n\nWhile the priest has the wizard spell in mind, she or he cannot pray for a spell to replace the still-pending anyspell. In effect, one 4th-level spell slot is \"lost\" until the wizard spell is cast, at which point the duration of anyspell comes to an end. Note that in order to make effective use of this spell, the priest must borrow the spellbook of a wizard friend or use a found wizard scroll. (Priests of Mystra are not otherwise able to use wizard scrolls.)

All creatures trapped within a briartangle when it forms—or those that enter it thereafter—suffer 1d4+2 points of piercing and scratching damage per round (or portion thereof) that they remain moving and in contact with the spell. Beings clad in banded, scale, or plate mail have all damage reduced to Id3 points per round. This reduced damage also applies to creatures made of rock or with skin of comparable hardness, but creatures with lesser armor, such as chain, take full damage, even if a shield is carried. Beings who do not move at all after the first round take only the damage from the first round of contact. In all cases, a successful saving throw vs. spell results in half damage (round up).\n\nSpellcasting requiring a somatic component is impossible within a briartangle. Cloth raiment and exposed cloth, paper, or vellum items must save vs. acid once per round (or portion thereof) that they are within the briartangle's confines and their user or owner is moving or they are rent and torn. This means that such items must make at least one item saving throw (for the initial round of contact). Magical items receive a +2 bonus to this saving throw. A briartangle vanishes instantly if the caster so wills, but otherwise exists until the spell expires or is dispelled. When the briartangle ends, the plants it grew from (the living material components) revert to their former state.\n\nFire destroys a briartangle in a round (regardless of the size of its area of effect), but creatures within it take 2d6 points of fire damage and receive no saving throw against this damage. The area where a briartangle was cast radiates a faint dweomer for 1d4+2 turns after the spell has expired, and this aftereffect can be used to confuse creatures who are following a pass without trace trail by detecting that spell's dweomer.\n\nIn addition to living plants of any type, which are transformed into the briartangle, required material components are mistletoe, a thorn from any plant, and a bud, petal, or leaf from a briar (wild rose).\n\nNotes: Granted by the god Silvanus, the Forest Father, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

The caster is unaffected by his or her own cloud of pestilence, as is any creature wearing or bearing a consecrated holy symbol of Talona. All other creatures caught in or entering the acrid, foulsmelling vapor cloud must make a saving throw vs. spell:\n\nDuring the first round of exposure to the vapors (or during initial exposure in the case of those who leave and reenter the area of effect), those who succeed at the saving throw are unaffected. Those who fail the saving throw take 1d4 points of damage and begin coughing violently. Spellcasting, normal speech, and tasks requiring Dexterity, such as opening locks, writing, and the like, are now impossible.\n\nOn the second round of exposure (or second exposure in the case of those who leave and reenter the area of effect), another saving throw must be made. If it is successful, the victim continues to cough and suffers another 1d4 points of damage. If the saving throw is unsuccessful, the vapors inflict 3d4 points of damage, the victim is slowed (as the spell), the victim continues to cough, and the victim's vision becomes blurred, resulting in a -2 penalty to all attack rolls, difficulty in telling friend from foe when the two are near each other, and an increased possibility of tripping, bumping into things or people, and like effects.\n\nOn the third round of exposure (or third exposure to the same cloud of pestilence in the case of those who leave and reenter the area of effect), another saving throw must be rolled. If successful, the victim takes 1d4 more points of damage and the coughing continues. If the victim fails the saving throw, she or he sinks into unconsciousness and takes 4d6 points of additional damage.\n\nOn the fourth round (or fourth exposure to the same cloud of pestilence), another saving throw must be rolled. If the victim succeeds at the saving throw, the vapors inflict 1d4 points of additional damage and the victim is caught in a coughing fit until the spell expires. If the victim fails the saving throw, the vapors inflict 4d6 points of additional damage, the victim continues coughing and is slowed for Id4+1 rounds after the cloud dissipates, and the victim contracts a lung disease that reduces his or her movement rate by 1, makes facial muscles twitch and tremble from time to time, and steals 1 hit point from the victim every 2 days. This hit point loss cannot be cured until the disease is cured and continues at the rate of 1 hit point every 2 days until death occurs or the disease is banished.

All beings in contact with the sphere lose the use of infravision for 2d4 rounds, which is halved if a saving throw vs. spell is successful.\n\nVampires and other undead, fungoid creatures, and subterranean fungi in contact with the sphere suffer 4d6 points of damage, which is halved if a saving throw vs. spell is successful. Upon their first contact (only) with the dazzling radiance, such creatures are affected as if by a confusion spell on the round following contact. Essentially, on first contact with the radiance, these creatures may continue an attack or fighting actions that bring them into the light, but on the next round they hesitate and are unable to attack or take any deliberate action.\n\nCreatures harmed by sunlight are affected by the radiance as if they were caught in actual sunlight. Undead vulnerable to sunlight receive a saving throw vs. spell to avoid destruction.\n\nThe caster of this spell can choose to have it delay and not take effect until a word of activation that was whispered during casting is spoken again. The spell effect occurs at any later time when the word is spoken unless the touched being dies first or is affected by a dispel magic. In addition, if the delayed form of the spell is cast on the caster, it may even be activated by silent force of will alone; no word need be spoken. The spell is not affected by other spellcasting or magical activity on the part of the caster, but its delayed effect cannot be unleashed in the same round as the caster activates a magical item or casts another spell.\n\nThe material components of the spell are an aster seed and a piece of sunstone (aventurine).\n\nNotes: Granted by the god of dawn Lathander of the Forgotten Realms setting."

The favor of Tytnora confers bonuses upon the saving throws of the recipient it affects. The first saving throw made by the recipient after the spell is successfully cast is made at a +4 bonus, even if it takes place later in the same round as the spell took effect. The second saving throw after the spell takes effect is at a +3 bonus, the next at a +2 bonus, and the following one at a +1 bonus. After the four enhanced saving throws occur, the magic is exhausted.\n\nTymora does not allow her favor to be granted to the same creature more than once in any day unless there are exceptional circumstances, such as a character championing Tymora's cause in open battle. Any attempt to cast Tymota's favor more than once a day on a nonworshiper of Tymora automatically fails.\n\nCreatures faithful to Tymora are looked upon with disfavor if they request the bestowal of a favor of Tymora more than twice in any tenday; to rely directly on the goddess is not to trust in her luck. This includes priests of Tymora, who may have to atone for any use of this spell on themselves that exceeds this rate.\n\nThe church of Beshaba employs a reversed form of this spell known as the bane of Beshaba. The spells favor of Tymora and bane of Beshaba automatically cancel each other out if cast on the same creature, regardless of how many saving throws the first spell to be cast has affected.\n\nNotes: Granted by Tymora, Lady Luck of the Forgotten Realms setting."

If the caster successfully strikes with the whip in combat, the struck creature suffers 2d4 points of damage. Undead are affected as if by a turning attempt by a priest of three levels higher than the whip-caster.\n\nLiving creatures struck by a whip of Shar must also make a successful saving throw vs. spell or be unable to attack on the following round because they are writhing in pain and unable to control their actions. Writhing victims incur no Armor Class penalties, but must make successful Dexterity ability checks to avoid dropping all held and wielded items (one check per item). Victims struck in successive rounds are less prone to falling victim to this facet of the whip's attacks due Xo a numbness produced from repeated exposure. Hits in successive rounds cause the second saving throw to be at a +1 bonus, the third saving throw to be at a +2 bonus, and so on. A whip of Shar has no effect on even the most fragile of nonliving objects and cannot be used to bind, constrict, or entangle. It is considered a magical weapon for purposes of which creatures it may strike.\n\nThe material components of this spell are three sharp-edged pieces of black obsidian or glass and a long, black hair from any evil creature.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Shar, Mistress of the Night, evil goddess of the Forgotten Realms setting."

The object may have been once living or even be presently living. When used on a living being, rosetouch closes gaping wounds—even over a foreign object—and closes off veins and arteries to prevent further blood loss, but cannot restore lost hit points, life force, or functioning organs, nor knit together severed limbs.\n\nAs the item is mended, the rosy glow pulses brightly, surrounds the item, and then fades. At the end of the round in which the rosetouch is bestowed, the item is whole.\n\nThis spell is often used to mend broken weapons or tools. Although it cannot restore the dweomer of a broken or expended magical weapon, its physical repair work is permanent and cannot be dispelled. A weapon that has been rosetouched gains no attack or damage bonuses, but counts as a magical weapon for purposes of what can be hit by it for 1 round per level of the caster of this spell.\n\nNotes: Granted by Lathander.

        "Introduction": "This spell enables a priest to contaminate pure water or substances, create a weak spot or irregularity (handhold or visible mark) in a wall of solid stone or surface of armor plate, and otherwise modify substances harmfully. Magical potions affected by a corrupt spell are reduced in the healing they bestow by 1d4 points; if no hit points are involved in their effect, their durations are reduced by 1d4 rounds. Holy water becomes merely water, but unholy water is doubled in efficacy (harmful effects). Normal drinking water remains drinkable, but it tastes tainted and does not cleanse things washed with it. Corrupted items have all their item saving throws against harm reduced by 3 points, unless they are magical. In addition, if an item is used as a weapon, the damage it inflicts is reduced by 2 points per attack for 1d3 turns. All magical functions and properties of enchanted items cease for 1d3 turns, though their own item saving throws are unaffected.\n\nThe caster of this spell must choose a single nonliving item or body of liquid to be affected by the spell. The magic does not affect all of a solid item larger in volume than the caster's body. In such cases, only a localized area is affected. For instance, a priest trying to contaminate a lake or large pool would succeed only in harming the water closest to his touch or the chosen area of effect that equals his body volume, not all the water). Corrupt involves a momentary flickering green radiance over the spot or item it is aimed at, but operates silently.\n\nIf three corrupt spells are cast on a single nonmagical item or on a specific spot in a large item (for instance, a place on a wall), the item must succeed at an item saving throw vs. acid or shatter/collapse/fall away, causing a hole at that location. Minor breakage in large items (in other words, a hole or cavity reaching a few inches into a thick stone wall) can be expanded by casting additional trios of corrupt spells. Through the use of corrupt, an imprisoned priest of Myrkul could, over time, breach a cell wall or cause manacles to fail.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Myrkul, Lord of the Dead, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

The caster then perceives the shadow person's surroundings dimly, as if seeing through eyes the person does not in tact possess. (This vision is not good enough to read by, see expressions, or recognize the features of a being.) This unintelligent aura of magical gloom cannot be used to cam' solid objects or convey magical effects requiring that a target be touched (though rumors hold that the most powerful Sharran priests employ an improved version of this spell that can do both those things). The shadow person can be used to lure, to warn (pointing to beings, objects, or even markings on a map), or for concealment.\n\nIf a living being walks within the creature of darkness, its magic expands it to completely cloak the being and so conceal its identity. Such a cloaked being can see as if the gloom of the creature did not exist. Living beings can attack or freely pass into, out of, and through a creature oj darkness without dispelling it. If a creature of darkness is worn in this manner by its creator, the caster can use the magic of the creature to levitate for up to four consecutive rounds (rising up to 20 feet per round) or as a feather fall. Either such usage ends the spell.\n\nThe material components of a creature of darkness are a bit of black or gray fur or down from any flying creature, a pinch of soot, and a strand of spider web.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Shar.

The caster can redirect them at any time by concentrating, so as to allow them to follow a winding road or simply to change direction. The spell is not ended, nor contact lost, if the caster engages in other spellcasting.

        "Introduction": "This spell consumes a single coin or metal disc and replaces it with two identical coins. The coins are absolutely identical, not just similar in type, and so scratches, special markings, and the like are reproduced. The spell destroys any dweomer that may be in existence on the coins. The spell is silent, but a faint, momentary glow accompanies the permanent change it causes. Each time the spells is cast, the caster must make a saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell is executed as intended and nothing untoward occurs. If the saving throw fails, the caster suffers the permanent loss of 1 hit point, but gains 2dl2 additional exact duplicate coins out of thin air. Although this magic affects coinage of any size and value, it can only work on metal, not on gems, wood trade tokens, or coinage made of a combination of materials where at least one component is nonmetallic.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a single coin or metal disc.\n\nNotes: Granted by the lesser power Waukeen Merchant's Friend of the Forgotten Realms setting."

This animated pen generates its own ink and copies any writing or inscription of the caster's choice that is within range onto any writing surface, such as paper, vellum, smooth painted wall, or flat wood, available within spell range. If there is a choice of writing surfaces available, the one chosen mentally by the caster is used.\n\nSpells can be copied by means of this spell, creating a copy that is identical to the original for purposes of study. Scrolls can be duplicated by the spell along with their magic. The quill's writing does not trigger explosive runes, glyphs, or other traps, and creates an identically functioning magical duplicate of such dangerous magic (if any is present).\n\nThe writing of a duplicate is of identical size and spacing to the original, allowing perfect forgeries to occur. However, if the size of writing surface or the spell duration does not permit the entire writing to be copied, the entire copied writing fades away, and the spell is lost and ruined. (The pen writes as fast as the caster can.) Being rendered unconscious or commencing other spellcasting ruins the magic. The caster must view the writing for the pen to work. (Brief glances away or interruptions do not harm the working of the spell.)\n\nThe mind of any caster can only encompass one duplicate spell at a time and attempts to go beyond this limit result in feeblemindedness (as the successful effect of the 5th-level wizard spell feeblemind). Casting duplicate causes the caster to instantly lose 1 hit point per experience level currently possessed. The loss of these hit points may only be reversed by the casting of a wish or limited wish spell or the casting of a heal spell on the recipient by a high priest of Oghma in the sanctuary of an Oghmanyte temple. No saving throw against the loss of the hit points is allowed. Death caused in this way destroys all spellcasting ability, so a priest who died casting duplicate and was raised could no longer function as a priest, but only a lay worshiper.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a feather.\n\nNotes: Granted by Oghma, Lord of Knowledge, in the Forgotten Realms setting."

Any creature bearing a symbol sacred to Torm can to pass through the hand and the sphere it defines without effect. Any other creature who approaches the guarded area feels a warning prickling in the air, an almost electric tension.\n\nIf the guarded area is entered, the intruding creature feels a solid force resisting its forward movement. The creature must make a successful saving throw vs. paralyzation at a -3 penalty to continue forward into the protected area and a second successful saving throw vs. paralyzation at a - 3 penalty to pass out of the guarded area at any other point except at the one entered. Failure of this Strength check causes the creature to be paralyzed for one turn per level of the caster or until freed by the caster, whichever occurs first.\n\nAny creature without a holy symbol of Torm who attempts to pass an area guarded by a hand of Torm is also slowed so as to require 2 rounds to enter or exit. Regardless of the results of the saving throw vs. paralyzation, the intruder must also make a saving throw vs. spell for each of these rounds. A successful saving throw means no damage is inflicted on the intruder. Failure indicates that a crushing, constricting force squeezes the intruder for Id6 points of damage in that round. Observers see the image of the hand closing about the intruder, but this is a visual effect only; a hand of Torm can constrict and hamper the progress of more than one creature within its confines at any one time.\n\nAny number of creatures can be affected by a hand of Torm without dissipating or exhausting it until its duration expires normally. A successful dispel magic destroys it instantly.\n\nThe material component of the spell is the priest's holy symbol (which is not consumed in the casting).\n\nNotes: Granted by the war god Torm in the Forgotten Realms setting."

The oak tree can be any distance from the spell recipient when the spell is cast and during its duration, so long as the spell recipient remains in Faerun.\n\nAt any time after this spell is cast, crushing the material component causes the spell to activate. For the next three rounds, any damage done to the spell recipient does not harm him or her, but instead affects the distant oak tree. The tree mystically becomes the target of all spells and the victim struck by all attacks. If the tree is dead before the spell is cast, the spell does not work, and the caster knows this, although the spell is lost. If the tree dies of the damage done to it during the oakheart spell, the linked being suffers a permanent loss of 3 hit points. The recipient of an oakheart spell does not regain hit points through rest until the tree is entirely healed because while it is injured, it receives the linked spell recipient's naturally healed hit points. The spell recipient can be magically healed during this time, though. A being may be linked through oakheart to only one oak tree at a time and can only have one oakheart in affect at a time.\n\nThe material component of the spell is an oak leaf.

        "Introduction": "This more powerful variant of the sticks to snakes spell transforms the oars aboard a ship into giant sea snakes. It may be cast in one of two modes: defensive or offensive.\n\nUsing the defensive mode, the caster essentially transforms the oars of his or her own vessel into sea serpent defenders. These serpents remain within the oarlocks of the vessel which bore them, but may attack beings outside of the ship who are nearby, such as boarders. Each serpent can attack one boarder once a round with a THAC0 11, inflicting 3d6 points of damage for each successful strike. The serpents remain until the spell expires or they are slain; they are 10 HD creatures of AC 5.\n\nThis spell may also be cast offensively. In this mode, the oars become serpents of similar Hit Dice and THAC0 to those above, but rather than attacking outside the ship, their poisonous heads are aimed within a ship within range (including the caster's ship), attacking the oarsmen and destroying the ship's ability to maneuver. The poisonous bite of these serpents does 1d6 points of damage, but anyone bitten must make a successful saving throw vs. poison against type C poison. Those who successfully save suffer only 2d4 points of additional damage; those who fail their saving throws suffer an additional 25 points of damage. The poison has an onset time of 1d4+1 minutes. Creatures struck repeatedly must make a saving throw every time they are bitten.\n\nWhile the spell continues, the ship does not have the use of those oars turned into serpents, and thus its speed may be reduced. The serpents turn back into usable oars when the spell expires, although those which were \"killed\" are broken and useless.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, snakes to oars, changes giant sea snakes to oars for the same duration or negates the oars to snakes spell according the level of the priest countering the spell (for example, a 12th-level priest casting snakes to oars can turn four sea serpents back into oars).\n\nThe material components of this spell are a small piece of wood and the scales from a sea snake.\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil sea goddess Umberlee of the Forgotten Realms setting."

No clue as to the precise nature of the magic is given by the spell, but protective circles, symbols, and glyphs can all be scrutinized in detail and might well be identified by someone familiar with them or recorded for later study. (Spellcraft proficiency checks might be applicable to determine that a marking is a glyph of warding and what its identity is, for instance.)\n\nReveal shows the presence of active or inactive gates or other links between planes, including the presence of an astral silvery cord, but does not reveal astral, ethereal, or invisible creatures or things. Unlike true seeing, the auras of creatures are not shown; nor are polymorphed or magically changed things shown for what they truly are (although the dweomer of an illusion, for example, would be seen).\n\nThe spell requires an ointment composed of four drops of wine, two drops of water, two drops of giant squid sepia, a pinch of powdered eyebright (an herb), a large powdered blue sapphire worth at least 1,000 gp, and a powdered carbuncle (a deep-red gamet) worth at least 300 gp. The caster mixes these in a ceramic or stone bowl, speaks the words of the spell while holding his or her holy symbol over the paste, and then applies it to the eyes of the recipient.\n\nThe reverse of the spell, conceal, masks all the above things from any creature to whom a different ointment is applied for one turn per level of the caster. (This ointment is composed of a pinch of powdered monkshood, six drops of onion juice, a pinch of dust, and seven drops of water, mixed and enspelled as above.) If during this time the affected being employs true seeing, detect magic, or equivalent magic, these spells appear to work, but the phenomena listed above are simply not seen by the affected creature. Awake, mobile creatures unwilling to have the ointment for either version of the spell applied to their eyes must be touched by the caster twice (two successful attack rolls required), but washing out the eyes or any means short of dispel magic or a limited wish does not prevent the ointment from working.\n\nNotes: Granted by Tempus, war god of the Forgotten Realms setting."

It can strike nonliving objects and can be wielded dexterously enough to lift latches, slide bolts open or shut, turn pages of books, and so on. The caster may freely move the sword from target to target unless physical or magical barriers (such as a wall of force) are in the way, but the caster must concentrate on the blade to maintain its existence and direct it. Other spellcasting is impossible while maintaining the spell, though the caster may move at half his or her normal movement rate per round while doing so.\n\nA seeking sword moves with Strength enough to parry and hold back another blade wielded by a strong human or humanoid. It can be used to shatter glass objects, spike open doors, puncture sacks, or search for unseen opponents by sweeping through apparently empty spaces or across windowsills and thresholds.\n\nThe material components for this spell are a drop of mercury and human hair.\n\nNotes: Granted by Helm the Vigilant of the Forgotten Realms setting."

        "Introduction": "This spell traps a short tune—one that the caster can sing with three breaths or less—in a stone. Whenever the stone is either tapped or entirely immersed in water, it emits the tune, repeating it at 1-tum intervals if immersion continues. Any solid stone no larger than the caster's fist will serve, and the music can consist only of sounds the caster can make himself (in other words, singing, playing an instrument, and thumping out a rhythm simultaneously as about as complex as the captured sound can be). In the past many gemstones have been used for this spell, though it is a false rumor that granite and other simple stones cannot carry tunes as beautifully.\n\nThe \"tune\" need not involve vocal sounds or may be a message spoken w chanted rather than sung—but in any case, the pitch, timbre, and inflections of the voice and/or instrumental sounds are precisely duplicated, and listeners could mistake the sounds of a singing stone for a particular person's usual voice. This spell has been used to prepare traps, leave behind wills or dying messages, and to preserve the best work of the bards. Certain temples of Milil have entire libraries of carefully racked stones. Long tunes are played back by tapping a row of stones, each one enchanted with this spell to capture a segment of the ongoing tune.\n\nThe maker of the sound to be captured must be the caster. There is no known way to use this spell to capture the words or song of another being. The spell does not pick up the words of others or background noise, even if such things were present as the spell was cast, but it does preserve throat clearings, mistakes, and other noises—such as the clatter of something dropped by the caster—that the caster may not want preserved. The sound is preserved at the volume level reaching the stone. Loud shouting or music is recorded as loud.\n\nThe spell range refers to the fact that the stone must be touched. The caster can, if desired, move away from the stone to achieve an echoing effect or a distant sound and may even choose to move continuously toward, away from, or around the stone while recording. The recorded sound will reflect this. The recording time is the three breaths following the round of casting when the stone is touched, and the magic causes the stone to glow a faint rose-red while it is capturing sounds.\n\nThe material component of a singing stone spell is a small hollow metal tube (chime).\n\nNotes: Granted by Milil, Lord of Song, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

The smoke ghost is not a living creature or sentient force. It cannot wear clothing, carry things, or be made to speak. It is merely an apparition with one attack ability: It can envelop a being and suffocate it with thick, choking smoke and ash.\n\nA smoke ghost is a cloud of thick, billowing gray smoke approximately 9 feet high by 2 feet in diameter. It is roughly man-shaped. It cannot achieve a greater stable volume, and its precise form is variable in accordance with the caster's wishes. A smoke ghost can rise into the air 10 feet per level of the caster or be made to sink to the ground, flowing along the earth like some sort of living blanket. It can seep and maneuver through cracks and crevices precisely as the caster wills. It can shift into a globe form or wall form in one-quarter of a round (15 seconds).\n\nThe smoke ghost attacks by attempting to envelop a creature. A saving throw vs. breath weapon must be made each round against the smoke ghost attack until the spell expires or the smoke ghost is moved to another target. If the saving throw is successful, the affected creature's attacks are at a -1 penalty, and 1 point of damage is inflicted upon the smoke ghost's victim at the end of the round. Affected creatures who make their saving throws are able to utter item command words, power words, or cast other spells that require only a single spoken word. Doing so wracks the affected creature with uncontrollable coughing fits for the following round, making them unable to take offensive action that round (but not affecting their saving throw).\n\nThe failure of this saving throw vs. breath weapon (either in the first round or a successive round) means the creature is enveloped. Enveloped victims are partially blinded; all their attacks are made at a - 2 penalty. They also take 1 point of damage at the end of the round. Enveloped victims find spellcasting and even normal speech impossible, resulting in violent retching and coughing when these are tried. These penalties and this rate of damage continue until the third round of envelopment.\n\nBeginning with the third round of envelopment, a creature must make a successful saving throw vs. death magic each round or be rendered unconscious through suffocation. Each following consecutive round of envelopment adds another -2 penalty to the roll (for a -2 penalty on the fourth round, —4 on the fifth, and so on).\n\nAssuming she or he is not killed through the accrual of damage (hit points reduced to below 0 or -10, if that optional rule is in use), an unconscious character eventually recovers. One-quarter (25%) of the smoke damage is actual, the rest is temporary.\n\nThe caster must be able to see the smoke ghost to direct it, and controlling the apparition requires the caster's full attention. The caster can cast no other spells nor take any other offensive action while controlling the smoke ghost, although the caster may voluntarily release control of it. An undirected smoke ghost hangs motionless until the caster takes control again, it is dispelled, or the spell expires. A victim who was being assaulted by a smoke ghost which becomes undirected is considered to automatically find himself or herself in fresh air (if such is available) on the round that the ghost becomes undirected. If subsequently reattacked by the smoke ghost, the entire attack sequence must be restarted from its beginning. Previous damage caused by the smoke ghost is assumed to linger until about a turn after the ghost finally disappears. A ghost that reaches the caster's maximum range stops and remains in place until directed elsewhere. The caster can will the ghost to disappear into nothingness at any time, an action that takes the smoke ghost takes half a round (30 seconds).\n\nIt can be destroyed by a gust of wind, dispel magic, or strong natural winds. Any magics that affect vapors also affect it. It is not affected by weapons.\n\nThe caster creates the smoke ghost by means of a pinch of dust and some mistletoe that are cast into an existing fire or cloud of smoke of magical or natural origin.\n\nNotes: Granted by the god Silvanus, the Forest Father, of the Forgotten Realms setting.",

The smoke ghost is not a living creature or sentient force, and cannot wear clothing, carry things, or can be made to speak. It is merely an apparition with one attack ability: it can envelop an opponent and suffocate it with thick, choking smoke and ash.

This means that suffocation occurs at the end of nine successive rounds of envelopment. Creatures who make a successful saving throw vs. spell can manage to utter item command words, power words, or cast some other spells and cantrips that require only a single spoken word; doing so usually wracks them with uncontrollable coughing fits for the following round.

A smoke ghost can rise up into the air 10 feet per level of the druid or be made to sink to the ground, flowing along the earth like some sort of living blanket, and can swoop and maneuver through cracks and crevices precisely as the druid wills. It can shift into a globe-form or wall-form in one-quarter round. A druid who cannot see his or her smoke ghost cannot direct it, nor can a druid whose concentration is turned elsewhere (such as casting another spell) do so. In both cases, the smoke ghost will hang motionlessly until it is dispelled or the spell expires—a ghost that reaches the caster's maximum range will also stop and remain in place until disappearing or until directed elsewhere by the caster. The caster can will the ghost to disappear into nothingness at any time (which takes one-half round). It can also be destroyed by a gust of wind, dispel magic, or strong natural winds.\n\nCrush the birthwort and foxglove, and sprinkle into a crucible containing the liquid sepia, lemming blood, cheetah blood, and holy water. Stir well, and place over a well-established fire.\n\nImmerse the pegasus heart in crucible and heat mixture steadily to boiling, stirring occasionally. The heart will dissolve slowly: when it is gone, add the powdered gems, and remove from heat, allowing the crucible to cool undisturbed. When cool, add the quicksilver: do not stir. Cover, keep in a dark place for at least four days and nights, and then uncover under the light of the moon (which must be waxing or full). Decant into a flask or vial, add human blood shake well.\n\nBoil the umpleby flesh and volt tail in a copper vessel, until the liquid has boiled away. Remove from heat and add the giant octopus ink and powdered copper, gemstones, stirring with the rod of ferrous metal. Pour into a stone bowl or depression and add the volt blood a drop at a time. Leave an end of the rod in the mixture. Lightning must then be induced to strike the rod: lightning of a natural storm is best, although magic such as lightning bolt, call lightning, and control weather-induced storms will do. Electrical charges of smaller magnitude (such as those produced by an umpleby, an electric eel, or a shocking grasp spell) can also be used but these must be applied repeatedly: once a night for six successive nights. (A combination of these sources may be employed.) After that, let stand. When the mixture turns blue, it is ready for use."

        "Introduction": "This spell causes water to rise up into a single directed strike of massive force. A large body of water must be present (in other words, a pond, lake, or the sea) or the spell is wasted. It cannot create water out of nothing, nor can it cause the contents of a tub or small, ornamental pool to do more than rise up in an impressive manner and crash back down again, splashing things nearby.\n\nA striking wave varies from 10 feet to 100 feet wide as the caster directs, moves in the direction its caster directs and can change direction in response to the caster's silent concentration, but it must travel at least 60 feet in a straight line before it can do harm; otherwise, items in its path simply ride up along its swell and are unharmed. The priest must be in contact with the water to cast the spell, although this contact can be as little as a hand or toe dipped into the wetness. The range of the spell applies to how distant the wave can form from the caster, not how far it can travel. If unhindered by impact or obstacle, the striking wave travels several miles before subsiding. If cast in a confined area, such as a harbor, so that it strikes a sea wall or other immobile obstacle within 100 feet of its forming, it rebounds back to where it was formed, doing double damage to creatures and items between.\n\nA striking wave smashes into immobile objects for 10d12 points of damage. Floating objects are allowed a saving throw vs. spell; if alive and swimming or free to move in the water, floating creatures are also allowed a second saving throw vs. spell. Each saving throw that succeeds removes three dice of damage, so swimmers who make both saving throws suffer only 4d12 points of damage. A rebounding wave must be saved for separately both times; one set of saving throws does not govern both strikes.\n\nStriking waves may attack targets on the shore; however, they lose force as they do so. For every 10 feet up the shore the wave travels, Idl2 of damage is lost from the wave.\n\nShips suffer structural damage from a striking wave as follows: A ship automatically loses 10% of its seaworthiness if at anchor or tied up dockside, but only 5% of it if floating freely; small open boats suffer double this damage. Open boats and barges may well be capsized by a striking wave. The Dungeon Master must adjudicate such situations. The DM must also determine damage done to wharves and other structures; however, such damage is rarely extensive unless the buildings' construction was not intended for marine or shore use.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a drop of water blessed by Umberlee or by a senior Umberlant in the name of the goddess.\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil sea goddess Umberlee of the Forgotten Realms setting."

The horror rises from the remains three rounds after spellcasting is complete, entering its armor. If armor is not present, the horror dissipates, and the spell is wasted.\n\nThe caster or another being must wear the armor as the horror enters it, a process described as \"unbearably chilling.\" This often causes the armor wearer to faint. The horror gains its knowledge of how to fill the armor and something of its independent reasoning from the armor wearer, who need not be of the proper class to use the armor. Once the horror has entered the armor, the armor should be removed, since within one turn it animates as a fully functional helmed horror. Details of a helmed horror are given in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting box in the MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM® sheets and in the MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM Annual, Volume One.\n\nThe remains need not be whole and are consumed in the casting, but they must be the remains of a creature that was of evil alignment for at least part of its life or the spell has no effect. The doom of Bane destroys the remains forever, preventing resurrection, animation as an undead creature, speak with dead, and similar activities from affecting them. A helmed horror is not regarded as an undead creature, however. It cannot be turned, affected, or dispelled by holy beings or things.\n\nThe material components of this spell are a pinch of bone powder or a bone shard of any origin, a pinch of dust, and a fairly complete, nonmagical, nonaligned suit of metal armor, which serves as the body of the helmed horror.\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil god Bane of the Forgotten Realms setting.\n\nHelmed Horror: AC 2; MV12, fly 12 (E) HD 4+1/level; THAC0 12; #AT 1; Dmg by weapon or 1d4 (fist); SD innate feather fall, immune to illusions, Enchantments/Charm spells, and mind affecting magic, healed by magic missile (excess reflects back at caster); immune to three specific spells chosen by creator, SZ M (6' tall); ML fearless (20); Int high (14); AL LN; XP 2,000."

The thorns fly up to 120 yards within the round of casting and strike as many targets as the priest wishes within the limits of the number of thorns able to be animated. The priest may direct the thorns in any combination at any living or nonliving (a scroll, lantern, or wineskin) targets that she or he can see. The priest can animate a maximum of four thorns per experience level.\n\nThe thorns strike only if a successful attack roll is made for each target. The attack roll is made as though the thorns were directly wielded by the priest and at a +4 attack bonus in addition to any other applicable bonuses the priest might have; no range penalties apply. The thorns inflict 1 point of damage each. Sleep-venomed wooden darts are sometimes carried by priest (especially druids) who use this spell often.\n\nThe missiles of a thorn spray twist and turn in flight to follow moving targets and avoid obstructions, and are fast enough to catch most birds on the wing. Thorn spray works underwater, but the priest has only normal attack rolls, and the range is reduced to 90 yards.\n\nThe material components for this spell are magical or natural barbs, spikes, thorns, spines, or nonmetallic darts that the priest animates.\n\nNotes: Granted by the god Silvanus, the Forest Father, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

While this radiance glows, the priest can attempt to touch and affect as many victims as she or he has normal attacks within that period of time. All creatures the priest manages to touch during that time become the victims of touch of the Talontar save for those beings the caster wills, during contact, the magic not to harm. A successful attack roll is required to touch a victim. If such a touch is made to any part of the victim (armor or clothing may be touched, as bare flesh contact is not required), the brown light flashes, and the victim must make a saving throw vs. spell.\n\nIf the saving throw succeeds, the victim takes 1 point of damage; the corrosive magic eats a hole in any armor or garment worn and causes a disfiguring eruption of the skin beneath the touched area into raw welts; and the spell's effects end for that victim. This wound inflicts a temporary loss of 2 points of Charisma upon the victim, but the wound vanishes and the ability score points are regained through normal healing rest or the use of curative magic (such as a cure light wounds).\n\nIf the saving throw fails, the victim suffers 6 points of damage and is slowed (as the spell) instantly until the end of the following round. On this second round, the victim must make another saving throw. If it succeeds, the victim suffers 1 point of damage, is corroded as discussed above, and the spell's effects end for that victim. If this second saving throw fails, the victim suffers 3d6 points of additional damage and must make a Constitution ability check and a Strength ability check. If both succeed, the spell's effects end for that victim. If one fails, the victim falls unconscious and takes an additional Id8 points of damage but can be roused on the following round or later if still alive. If both checks fail, the victim takes an additional ldlO points of damage, falls into a coma instantly, and cannot be roused by any known means for 1d12+2 rounds.\n\nOnce the touch of the Talontar is cast, the casting priest is free to take any other desired actions, including touching other victims (within the spell duration), casting other spells, or attacking with a weapon. Note that the effects of touch of the Talontar cannot be transmitted through a weapon, but only through the hand of the casting priest.\n\nNotes: Granted by Talona, Mistress of Disease, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

It can squeeze through any hole that one of the caster's hands, up to the wrist, could pass through, and the caster can change its shape at will. (Quite specific forms can be taken, so that the shadow can point like a hand, etc.) The shadow glides along the ground or floor at MV 15, feather falling gently to earth if it moves over a sudden drop off. It cannot ly or rise except by moving up a stair, or climbing a wall, rock face, or inine that the caster could traverse.\n\nThe caster can move the shadow wherever desired, seeing in any direction from it by silent effort of will. The shadow is visible, and will no doubt attract attention if it moves, stops, moves again, and appears to follow beings— especially when no shadow should be present—but there is no visible eye or other indication that the caster is watching through the shadow. The caster's mind cannot be contacted by beings employing magic or psionics on the shadow. The caster can see out of the shadow as far and as well as if his or her own eyes were present where the shadow is and the gloom of the shadow was not.\n\nThe presence of lead or gorgon's blood in walls (or their mortar) serves as a barrier against the viewing linkage of shadow to caster, but the caster retains control of the spell effect. If the shadow can be moved \"blind\" to a spot where there is no effective intervening barrier, the visual link is restored.\n\nWatching shadow only functions on its caster's current plane of existence.\n\nUnlike a listening shadow, a watching shadow spell ends instantly if its caster undertakes any other spellcasting.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Mask, god of thieves of the Forgotten Realms setting."

Creatures in the area of effect when the spell is cast (or those entering the area of effect while the spell is in effect) must make a saving throw vs. spell or suffer 1d4 points of damage.\n\nOn the second round of the spell, the priest can cause a lightning bolt to issue forth from the storm at any target within range, inflicting Id6 points of damage per level of the caster to a maximum of 10d6 points. Bolts fired from the cloud behave in the same way as those created by the lightning bolt 3rd level wizard spell, and all affected creatures are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell for half damage. Creatures within the cloud in a round when a lightning bolt is projected make their saving throws with a —4 penalty.\n\nEvery other round, the cloud releases one lightning bolt in a manner and at targets selected by the caster. The cloud produces a total of five lightning bolts before the spell expires. In the intermediary rounds between lightning bolts, the casting priest is free to perform other actions, including melee attacks and spellcasting. At the start of each even-numbered round, however, the priest directs the lightning bolt to its target and thus loses his or her normal action for that round.\n\nNotes: Granted by the air god Akadi of the Forgotten Realms setting."

Any attacks by a creature who does make a successful saving throw are made with a -7 penalty to attack rolls. On the following round, creatures affected by the candle of calm can act freely, but their attack rolls are at a -6 penalty. On the second round after the candle vanishes, attack rolls at a -5 penalty, and on the third round, they are at a —4 penalty, and so on until the penalty vanishes on the seventh round after the disappearance of the candle of calm.\n\nThe radiance of the candle also causes the same happiness effect in creatures as the 4th-level wizard spell emotion and banishes any existing natural or magical discord, fear, hate, hopelessness, and sadness. Once the candle has been created, its caster is free to engage in other spellcasting without harming its magic.\n\nThe material components of this spell are an unlit candle of any sort and a piece of clear crystal or glass.\n\nNotes: Granted by Lliira.

Within the area of effect, wind effects are negated, even if of magical origin, and the caster can hold a vapor stationary or move it up to 10 feet per level each round in any desired direction. If the vapor passes out of the stationary area of effect of the spell, control is lost.\n\nCreatures in gaseous form (such as vampires) and those wind walking receive no saving throw against the spell. A vapor cannot alter its form, be altered in form, nor be split into several vapors unless the caster so wills; however, creatures normally able to alter their nongaseous form into another form (such as a corporeal one) can do so whether the caster desires them to or not. The process of changing form takes twice as long as usual while they are affected by control vapor.

Functional dark promises include: “Do not return to (name of place)” or “Never again attack a priest of Bane.” A target creature that makes a successful saving throw vs. spell is not affected.\n\nIf the promise is violated, affected spell targets lose 1 hit point per violation of the dark promise until they are dead. Curing and other means of recovering hit points do not restore damage done by a dark promise spell, and these hit points are permanently gone (short of a wish spell). The dark promise can be lifted by the original caster of the spell, a wish spell, or a remove curse cast by a good priest of higher level than the caster of the dark promise. If an (unwilling) target of a dark promise spell makes a successful saving throw vs. spell when the spell is cast, it has no effect.\n\nOnly one dark promise may be in effect on a being at one time. Any successive dark promise spells cast automatically fail.\n\nThe main components of a dark promise spell are the name of the person the spell is to be cast upon and a carefully worded promise statement.\n\nThe dark promise spell was used exclusively by priests of Bane centuries ago to make sure their hidden cults, temples, and covert members were protected from the bias of the general populace. As Bane's power grew to a point where Banites were no longer hunted, the spell was no longer needed, and its use has since dwindled away.\n\nNotes: Granted by death gods such as Bane and Cyric of the Forgotten Realms setting."

Victims of forgotten melody must make a successful saving throw vs. spell at a —4 penalty or mentally obsess on that song. They cannot get the song out of their heads until they finish it, and they worry the lyrics around in their minds over and over trying to remember them and complete the song. While victims are trying to finish the song, they cannot cast spells or use psionic abilities since they cannot focus on any other intense mental activity other than finishing the song.\n\nForgotten melody is especially devastating to very intelligent beings, who tend to be able to concentrate intensely, since it subverts that very capability. The duration of the spell is determined by the Intelligence of the being affected by it: Beings who fail their saving throws are affected for the number of rounds equal to their Intelligence. This duration is affected by their magical defense adjustment (determined by Wisdom). Those affected beings with a magical defense adjustment bonus may subtract the number of rounds equal to the bonus from the spell's duration; those with a magical defense adjustment penalty must add the number of rounds equal to the bonus to the spell's duration.\n\nMindless undead creatures and creatures with animal intelligence or less (an Intelligence of 1 or less) cannot be affected by a forgotten melody, and neither can beings who cannot hear or do not understand the language of the caster (although the caster may employ magical means to make himself or herself understood and then affect such creatures).\n\nNotes: Granted by Milil, Lord of Song, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

It cannot be made to lie by any known means. By the power of Tyr, this spell indicates absolute truth. If a questioned being answers with a lie that the being believes to be the truth, a lie is still indicated by the hammer hue (and vice versa).\n\nThe illusionary hammer appears wherever the caster desires (within range), and thereafter moves to maintain the same distance from and orientation to the caster. The spell range refers to both how distant the hammer can initially be from the priest and how far from the hammer any questioned being can be for its truth-indicating ability to function. If someone questioned is out of range, the hammer grows dim, but the spell does not end. The caster can ask questions of any number of beings one at a time, and the telltale hammer is bright and visible to all.\n\nThe hammer cannot be made to disappear before the spell expires even by its caster. The illusory hammer cannot be contacted or disturbed by any known magical or physical attack. Though magical barriers of 6th or greater level can ward it away from a given area, there is no known means of destroying it. Dispel magic has no effect on a hammer of justice.\n\nWhen the spell does end, the hammer goes dark and seems to fall before it fades away entirely.\n\nThe material component for the spell is a miniature war hammer fashioned from diamond, obsidian, ivory, glass, or another pure, single-hued, black, white, or red, nonliving substance (cost varies with materials, but average is 25 gp).\n\nNotes: Granted by Tyr the Just God of the Forgotten Realms setting.

While the spell is in effect, the caster is enveloped in a golden radiance and is immune to all attacks except those caused by cold-, darkness-, or shadow-based spells, spell-like abilities, magical items, or breath weapons. While but one round of time passes for those not affected by the spell, the priest is able to spend two rounds, plus one round per level (to a maximum 1 turn total), in contact with his or her deity. Thus, a 5th-level priest can seek illumination for seven rounds while one round passes for all others. The priest can request information in the form of questions that can be answered by a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\" The priest is allowed one such question per phantom round. Optionally, the DM may give a single short answer of five words or less rather than answering \"yes\" or \"no.\" The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity's knowledge. (\"I don't know\" is a legitimate answer.) The spell will, at best, provide information to aid character decisions, and the deity contacted structures its answers to further its own purposes.\n\nWhile affected by the illumination spell, rather than ask a question during a round, the caster can request that the power contacted bestow a cure light wounds, cure blindness or deafness, cure disease, prayer, or free action spell upon him or her. The casting of any of these spells other than cure light wounds, which may be granted up to four times, ends the spell, and no further questions are answered by the deity contacted. The caster cannot cast spells on others while affected by an illuminate spell, nor can she or he move, become invisible, or engage in any other action other than those described above.\n\nThe material components of this spell are the priest's holy symbol and holy water.\n\nNotes: Granted by the sun god Amaunator of the Forgotten Realms setting."

It is a maximum of 15 feet per level of the caster long, though the caster may make it shorter if space is constricted. It can climb or descend and sticks to its endpoints unshakably, even if these endpoints are actually empty air above known ground features.\n\nBeings walking on a moon path are protected as follows: They cannot be drained of abilities or experience levels (life force), they cannot be harmed by normal missiles, they are immune to all enchantment/charm spells (although they can sense enough of a spell effect to identify it for what it does), and they cannot fall over or off the moon path, no matter what force strikes it or them.\n\nA moon path needs no supports, cannot be shattered or moved by any known force, and is stable enough to cast spells from. It vanishes if struck by a successful dispel magic, if the caster wills it to, or if it has been completely traversed by as many beings as the caster has experience levels. Otherwise, it persists for 1 turn/level of the caster. Beings on a moon path that expires or vanishes are subject to normal falling damage when they strike whatever hard surface is below. A magical barrier of the 6th or greater spell level stops a forming moon path or truncates an existing one where the two meet, but the caster cannot choose to banish only a part of his or her moon path in a similar manner. Loss of one part of a moon path has no effect on remaining parts, even if the loss cuts the path in two.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a handful of powdered moonstone.\n\nNotes: Granted by Selune the Moonmaiden of the Forgotten Realms setting."

This does no damage and has no adverse effects save to cause an affected being's voice to grow rough and quavery and to cause the being's skin to become very wrinkled (because it hangs more loosely).

The beam fades from existence the moment the victim has been struck, and the caster does not need to concentrate on the spell's effects past this point. The beam infects the victim with a mold that sucks moisture and nutrients from living flesh, causing it to shrivel and turn brown. The target must make a saving throw vs. spell. Success means only 1d8 points of damage is inflicted by the mold, but failure means the victim suffers 2d8+2 points of damage. On every round thereafter the victim must make another saving throw vs. spell. The same spell damage (1d8 points or 2d8+2 points) continues until the victim has successfully saved twice. The second successful saving throw ends the spell. Cure disease ends this spell instantly, as does any magic that kills molds or prevents damage done by them.\n\nRising rot has no effect on undead creatures, incorporeal beings, or creatures lacking body tissue (such as elementals). Sages believe that the Darkbringer's cult has fashioned numerous wands, known as wands of rotting, which can cast rising rot upon command.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a handful of mold spores from any source and of any type.\n\nNotes: Granted by Moander the Darkbringer of the Forgotten Realms setting."

        "Introduction": "This spell was developed by priests of Moander centuries ago as a method of enslaving sentient beings to the will of Moander. The spell itself results in the creation of a seed of Moander, which can then transform a victim into a servant of Moander.\n\nTo create a seed of Moander, a priest wraps an emerald fragment in a ball of rotting plant material. The resulting spherical proto-seed is soaked in unholy water for 24 hours and then cursed (the reverse of the bless spell) in the name of Moander. The priest then casts seed of Moander while touching the proto-seed, transforming the sphere into a green, spine-covered burr about the size and shape of a horse chestnut burr. The seed is sticky, and the spines end in tiny hooks.\n\nA seed of Moander attaches itself to the skin of any living, sentient creature it comes into contact with who is not already a Minion of Moander. The seed bursts on the round following its attachment and releases a 3-foot-diameter cloud of spores. Seeds may be thrown (range is 10/20/30); however, they do not break open unless they strike living beings. (Treat such seeds that miss their targets as grenadelike missiles and consult the Scatter Diagram in the DMG for where they land.) Any living, sentient creature within the area of effect of the spores (who is not already a Minion of Moander) must make a saving throw vs. spell. If it fails the saving throw, the spores are inhaled and begin transforming the host. If it succeeds, the spores are not inhaled, and the transformational effects of the seed of Moander are negated. Unburst seeds of Moander burst when they contact living flesh. They are destroyed by being drenched in holy water and blessed (as the spell).\n\nIf a victim is not treated, the spores grow, making the creature into a puppet of Moander (one of Moander's mind-controlled servants) in 4d4 days and also turning his or her entrails into a festering mass of rotting, mold-encrusted tendrils that eventually (in 5d6+30 days, unless delayed by the application of slow rot spells) reduce their host to a dried-out husk, killing him or her. Externally the host appears unchanged until death except for the faint odor of pollen and a small flowered vine wrapped around one ear. A victim who shares body fluids with another creature—as little as a kiss is sufficient—can transfer the spores of a seed of Moander to that creature, spreading the Darkbringer's influence. (The potential new host receive a saving throw vs. spell at a +2 bonus for each instance of exposure to avoid infestation.)\n\nOnly if Moander is completely absent from the Realms (in other words, all of the god's avatars and manifestations in the Realms have been destroyed) is the original host able to express its free will after it would have normally become a mind-controlled being. However, without the stabilizing effect of Moander's power, the body decays at an accelerated rate once the initial 4d4-day period is passed and becomes a rotting mass of plant material in a tenday.\n\nIf a victim infested with the spores of a seed of Moander drinks holy water within 1 hour of the spores affecting it, the spores dissolve and the victim is cured. If holy water is drunk within 2 days of the spores' entry, their growth is slowed to half rate (in other words, the possession and rotting take twice as long). A cure disease or heal spell used within 30 days of initial corruption by the spores stops the possession and the corruption process, allowing the victim to live and slowly heal inwardly. Cold magic that deals the infested body more than 20 points of damage also slays the spores' growth, allowing the victim to slowly recover. Typically, victims cured by cure disease, heal, or cold damage who do not receive a (second) heal, a restoration, or a regeneration spell have their Strength and Constitution reduced to half for 20+1d12 days. At the end of that time, they slip into a coma, lose 4d4 hit points, and a day later, if they survived the damage, awaken fully cured.\n\nA newly created puppet of Moander retains all of its previous abilities and skills, but all of its thoughts are known to Moander, and it is under the complete control of the Rotting God. In addition, the newly created minion can sprout one or two 10-foot-long tentacles at will from any orifice or directly through its skin. Each tendril (AC 2; 12 hp each; 2d8 points of bludgeoning/ constricting damage per successful attack) can attack once per round until destroyed. If a tendril is destroyed, the minion can sprout another tentacle the following round. If both tendrils hit a small or man-size creature in the same round, the victim is entangled (as the spell of that name) until she or he is released or escapes.\n\nThe material components of this spell are an emerald fragment (base value 100 gp) and Moander's holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Granted by Moander the Darkbringer of the Forgotten Realms setting."

Victims who succeed at their saving throw vs. spell are unaffected by the vinelike tendril, and the spell dissipates immediately.\n\nThe clear spirit prison lasts for 1 day per level of the spellcaster.

The storm cone lasts for 4 rounds plus 1 round for every three whole levels of experience the caster has above 9th level (5 rounds at 12th level, 6 at 15th level, etc.).\n\nA storm cone whirls about all beings it touches, buffets them with invisible \"stones\" of solid air contained within the storm cone, and stabs them with tiny lightning bolts that arc about continuously within the vortex. The whirling and buffeting effect forces touched beings to make saving throws vs. fall and crushing blow for all worn or carried items and inflicts on all creatures 5d4 points of damage. The lightning bolts strike creatures touched by the storm cone for an additional 2d4 points of damage and force affected beings to make saving throws vs. lightning for all worn or carried items unless they are protected against electrical damage. Both buffeting damage and lightning damage are suffered in each round of contact with the storm cone.\n\nA successful saving throw vs. spell halves the physical damage (round down); there is no save against the lightning. Beings caught within a storm cone cannot cast spells or launch attacks and can only fight free of the storm cone by making successful Strength and Dexterity ability checks on the same round.\n\nNotes: Granted by Talos the Destroyer, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

        "Introduction": "The annals of the church of Helm relate that in ancient times Helm, He of the Unsleeping Eyes, created the ultimate guardian to assist his necessarily fallible human followers. This creature, known as a spectator, appeared as a large orb dominated by an unblinking central eye with four stalks sprouting from the top of the orb to watch in each of the cardinal directions. In a dark time in the church's distant history, the forces of evil gained the upper hand for a while. During this bleak period, various gods of evil corrupted Helm's creations into the horrors known as beholders and their kin. Priests of Bane claim this is so much hogwash; they believe that the Black Lord created the eye tyrants as the ultimate rulers, and spectators are Helm's poor attempt at copying Bane's magnificent creation. The truth is unknown, although priests of Helm are known to destroy beholders and their kin wherever possible, and the remaining priests of Bane (and Xvim) return the favor to spectators whenever possible.\n\nThis spell enables priests of Helm to summon nearly infallible guardians to assist in their ordained tasks. Summon spectator summons one of Helm's spectator servitors from Mechanus to the Prime Material Plane to serve for up to 101 years in a specified task. (Spectators are detailed under the Beholder and Beholder-kin entry in the MONSTROUS MANUAL™ tome.) The task must involve the guarding of some location or inanimate physical object, such as a portal, shrine, or a holy relic. (The scope of things a spectator summoned by summon spectator will guard is broader than what one summoned by the particular variant of the 7th-level wizard spell monster summoning V that normally summons spectators will guard.) It allows no one except the one who summoned it or another priest of Helm to enter the location it is guarding or to use, borrow, or examine an item or treasure it watches over. It is not gullible and can fairly easily detect false claims to membership in Helm's priesthood by questioning such claimants telepathically about details of the church's rituals and beliefs.\n\nA summoned spectator does not abandon its post unless slain or blinded in all five eyes, in which case it automatically returns to Helm's tower in Mechanus. Its eyes regenerate in 24 hours, after which time it returns to its post. If the object is gone or the location breached when it returns (it can automatically tell), it again leaves for Mechanus, never to return.\n\nThe material components for this spell are the priest's holy symbol and a steel gauntlet blessed in the name of Helm; the latter is consumed in the casting.\n\nNotes: Granted by Helm the Vigilant of the Forgotten Realms setting."

Tree healing can do nothing against any poisons except tree poisons, which it always neutralizes.\n\nIf a tree containing a priest is damaged, the priest takes half of the damage but is free to leave the tree at any time.

        "Introduction": "This spell enables a priest of Myrkul to duplicate the powers of a staff of withering. Once cast, the spell lasts for up to six rounds ot until a successful attack to touch a victim is made. The priest of Myrkul may take other actions once the spell is cast and need not concentrate to maintain it, though the effect of the spell can only be transmitted through the priest's hand or another limb, not a weapon.\n\nA successful hit inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage, ages the victim by 10 years, and, if the victim fails a saving throw vs. spell, causes one of the creature's limbs to shrivel and become useless. Check by random number generation for which limb is struck. (For example, on humanoid creatures roll 1d4: l=right arm, 2=left arm, 3=right leg, 4=left leg.) The aging effect causes the victim's abilities and lifespan to be adjusted for the resulting age increase and can cause ability scores to drop or an elderly victim to die of old age.\n\nAll effects are permanent unless cured. Regenerate restores a withered limb to normal, and rest or curative magic cure the damage done, but only a limited wish, wish, or other magic specifically able to cure or abate aging can restore the victim's youth.\n\nThis spell has no effect on beings bearing holy symbols of Myrkul. Ageless creatures and noncorporeal beings (undead, elementals, tanar'ri, baatezu, and other powerful extraplanar beings) cannot be aged or withered.\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil god Myrkul in the Forgotten Realms setting."

Breath weapon: Ibrandlin breathe fire every fifth round in a cone 5 feet wide at the mouth, 10 feet wide at the end, and 15 feet long for 2d6 points of damage, save vs. breath weapon for half. While they cannot bite while breathing, an attack roll is made when breathing; if successful, the foe directly in front of the breath weapon takes maximum damage (12 points) with no saving throw. Pinning: With a successful attack roll, an ibrandlin can pin a foe beneath its body in lieu of three claw attacks. A pinned foe who continues to fight (using spells with verbal-only components or at an attack and damage roll penalty of -3), will be crushed for 1d4 points of damage per round. A single ibrandlin can pin up to five man-sized creatures. Escaping a pin requires successful Strength and Dexterity checks in the same round, even if the ibrandlin is dead. Escaping from beneath a held or paralyzed ibrandlin is at a -10 penalty to the ability checks. Throwing: Ibrandlin hurling or throwing objects attack at a -3 penalty; misses land 1d10 feet from the intended target."

Dance of the fallen is very similar to blade barrier, except that it creates a wall of body parts, not of edged weapons. A dance of the fallen calls up a whirling cloud of severed limbs, some bony and some still bearing flesh, but all curiously bloodless. These remains are said to be summoned from recent battlefields, and they rotate at high speed around a central point, forming an immobile barrier. The plane of rotation of the body parts can be horizontal, vertical, or any angle in between the two. The area of effect of the dance of the fallen is set mentally by the caster upon casting the spell (from as little as a 5-foot-diameter cylinder that is 5 feet tall or thick to as large as a 60-foot-diameter cylinder that is 20 feet tall or thick) and cannot be altered thereafter.\n\nAny creature trying to pass through the barrier suffers 4d6 points of damage and must make a Constitution ability check to avoid being struck senseless. All fragile worn or carried items must make a successful item saving throw vs. crushing blow or be destroyed. Beings who insist on trying to cross through the dance of the fallen and are not rendered immediately unconscious take 1d3+2 rounds to cross through the area of effect and must take damage and make Constitution checks each round.\n\nBeings within the barrier's area of effect when it forms must make a saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw succeeds, they escape the barrier by the most direct route and suffer no damage. If they saving throw fails, they suffer the full damage of the dance of the fallen. Any other intended action than leaving the area when the barrier is formed—such as a charge toward the caster—invites the full effects of the dance of the fallen.\n\nOnly 25% of the damage done by dance of the fallen is permanent; the rest is temporary and returns after 1d4 hours are spent resting. Beings reduced to 0 hit points or lower by this spell are rendered unconscious and ejected from the area of effect. They regain consciousness in 1d6 turns or more quickly (1d6 rounds) if a successful healing proficiency check is made upon them. The cloud of limbs remains until the spell expires and then fades silently away. It can also be dismissed instantly by the caster at any time.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a handful of bone shards or hair of any type.\n\nNotes: Granted by the god war god Tempus of the Forgotten Realms setting."

A target creature who succeeds at this initial saving throw is slowed (as the spell of that name) for 1 round by the impact of the spell but is then free of further effects. If the initial saving throw fails, the victim suffers 1 point of damage per level of the caster of the dolorous decay, is slowed for the following round, and is then allowed a second saving throw. If this saving throws succeeds, the spell ends without further effect; if it fails, the victim takes half the previous decay damage (round fractions down), and is slowed for a third round.\n\nThis cycle of saving throws and resulting damage continues, each bout of damage being half that suffered on the previous round, until a minimum loss of 1 point is reached; at that point only 1 point of damage continues to be inflicted until the victim succeeds at a saving throw. The cycle of spreading decay continues until the victim dies or succeeds at a saving throw, which breaks the spell. Dolorous decay is not contagious, but it can (at the DM's option) cause loss of mobility or the use of limbs if the damage is severe enough. (Typically over half the victim's hit points must be lost.)\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil god Myrkul, Lord of the Dead, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

        "Introduction": "This spell creates an illusory, many-armed, noisy mechanical construct of impressively massive appearance that floats about as the caster wills at MV Fl 4 (C) and attempts one of the following tasks, as determined by the caster: It pushes, pulls, lifts, digs, throws, or thrashes and flails with a tool or weapon.\n\n\n * Push: It can push on a boulder, on a building to make it fall over, on a wall to collapse it or break through it, on a door to force it open, or simply push heavy furniture or carcasses. The movement rate it moves at while pulling is 80 feet per round over solid rock or stone construction, 60 feet per round over earth and loose rock, such as rubble or an avalanche, and 40 feet per round over loose earth or mud. Walls receive a saving throw of 12 or greater to be unaffected or to stand fast on any given round against its push.\n * Pull: It can pull massive weights up an incline or cliff to a weight limit of 50 times the caster's own body weight. The fantastic machine's contact is by a shadowy, magical grip on the item, not any grip that could mar or break it. Its movement rates are as under pushing.\n * Lift: A fantastic machine can lift with the same limitations as pulling.\n * Dig: A fantastic machine digs a 10-foot-diameter hole 80 feet deep per round through loose earth, such as a mudslide. It digs the same diameter of hole 60 feet deep per round through earth and loose rock, such as an avalanche, or 20 feet deep per round through solid rock or stone construction. It digs a 20-foot-diameter hole at half these stated movement rates. It may dig a 10-foot-diameter hole horizontally (a tunnel) at the same rates as it digs a 20-foot-diameter hole vertically.\n * Throw: It throws ropes, rocks, or even rocks with ropes attached to them (to cross a chasm with a line, etc.). Its accuracy is determined by the caster's own THAC0; misses land where determined by the Scatter Diagram in the Grenade-Like Missiles subsection of the Missile Weapons section of the Combat chapter of the DUNGEON MASTER Guide. It can hurl items up to 1d20x100 feet. Hurled items deal damage according to their nature. A fantastic machine can hurl items no heavier than its pulling weight limit; a boulder that heavy would do 12d12 points of damage with a direct hit.\n * Thrash and Flail: A fantastic machine can thrash and flail rapidly with a tool or weapon to crush thickets and brambles to pulp, thresh grain, or smite all creatures within a 30-foot-wide, 20-foot-deep area selected by the caster with 2d4+2 melee weapon attacks per round. The damage of these attacks is determined by the melee weapon used (decided on by the priest at the spell's casting and limited to one-handed weapons only). Mobile targets are allowed a saving throw vs. spell each round. If the saving throw is successful, these targets suffer only half damage from any successful attacks.\n\nA fantastic machine has no tangible existence and can attempt only a single task, fading away when the spell expires even if the task is unfinished (in other words, a partially lifted item would be dropped). Despite the illusory nature of the bulky construct, the magic applies very real force to its surroundings. It has made Gondar priests—who preserve the spell as one of their most holy secrets, rarely writing down all of its symbols in one place or tome—most respected in some circles.\n\nThe material components of a fantastic machine are a drop of water, a fragment of adamantite or adamant (the ore adamantite is derived from), a cog or toothed wheel fashioned of any metal, and a strand of spiderweb.\n\nNotes: Granted by the god Gond, Lord of All Smiths, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

This spell is used only by high-ranking and somewhat desperate priestesses of Sune, who use it to retain a certain youth and charm and to avoid the shame of being cast out of the clergy when they can no longer hold off the ravages of age. The use of this spell has fallen out of favor in the church, but knowledge of the prayer is retained in the Sunite liturgy.\n\nUpon casting this spell, the caster links herself with a tree and unites with it so that she actually becomes a dryad (as in the MONSTROUS MANUAL tome), losing her spellcasting and other class abilities in the process, but getting all a dryad's powers in their stead. As this spell is not reversible, it is used rarely and only by individuals willing to leave this world and relinquish their positions to a new generation. At the end of the ceremony, the caster must pass a system shock roll or die.\n\nSuccessful use of this spell requires a tree willing to accept the dryad-tobe (which can be learned by a speak with plants spell), the presence of two willing assistants of the Sunite church (preferably clergy), and the caster's holy symbol. The system shock roll that marks the conclusion of the spell is penalized by -10% for every component of the spell ritual that is missing (for instance, -10% for not finding a willing tree, -10% for only one assistant, etc.).\n\nNotes: Granted by Sune, Lady of Love, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

        "Introduction": "This dark and evil spell creates long, slimy, black roots of foul look and manner. These plant things grow from any surface the spell was cast on with astonishing speed and attempt to strangle the poor person (or people) who triggered the spell; they wrap themselves around the neck of their victim. These roots attack collectively as a priest of the same level as the caster.\n\nThe caster of this spell chooses exactly what condition triggers it. The condition can be of any complexity—for example \"Kill only Tallfellow halflings wearing magical black leather armor with a red rose painted on their left shoulders.\" However, the spell cannot know the name or alignment of a being, nor can it be set off by undead or plantlike creatures. The most common way to use this spell is to cast it at a mandatory passage point of the intended target (for example, the bed of a king).\n\nThis spell creates 1d1OO tiny roots per square yard, any of which is sufficient to strangle a human-sized opponent. Each of them can project itself up to 5 yards in order to attack. Potential victims thus have to fight several hundred roots originating from several square yards of surface. When called forth by being activated, the roots make no more noise than a leaf falling from a tree, so only individuals with an exceptional sense of hearing would deny the roots a -4 bonus to surprise rolls.\n\nEntrapped victims can hold their breath a number of rounds equal to one-third of their Constitution score. Beyond that time they must make a Constitution ability check every round with a -2 cumulative penalty or perish. Characters with the Swimming proficiency gain an additional round before they begin making Constitution ability checks. Characters with the Endurance proficiency can hold their breath a number of rounds equal to twothirds their Constitution score and then make Constitution ability checks with no penalty the first round and accrue only a cumulative -1 penalty per round after the first check.\n\nVictims ensnared by this spell can attempt to sever the roots that strangle them. The mass of roots is AC 6, but only slashing (Type S) weapons have any effect against the roots. If trapped victims use any weapon larger than a dagger, they suffer a -3 penalty to their attack rolls against the roots. Slashing weapons sever five times their damage roll in roots, and area-of-effect damaging spells also destroy that many roots. A total of 2dl00 roots and tendrils holds a victim. If all of them are destroyed and a victim succeeds at a Strength ability check, then she or he is able to escape the spell's area of effect.\n\nCharacters attacking from outside the initial area of effect do not suffer any penalty when attacking the roots. However, they are also are in danger since the roots can turn in response to their attacks and attack these characters as long as they are within a 5-yard range of the initial area of effect.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a rotting leaf or a rotting piece of wood and the holy symbol of the caster.\n\nNotes: Granted by Moander the Darkbringer of the Forgotten Realms setting."

The victim receives a saving throw vs. spell, which negates the effect if the saving throw is successful.

        "Introduction": "This spell can be employed in three ways: If cast on a spot where there is no running watercourse, it causes water to spring up from the earth. If cast on an existing spring, it purifies the water and makes it totally transparent and nondistorting to the caster's eyes. If cast on the casting priest while she or he is in contact with a spring, the magic performs a limited sort of teleport.\n\nThe first function of the spell causes water to flow up from a spot on the ground forever if enough subterranean groundwater is present to feed a spring. If there is no water around, it causes a steady flow of water of Eldath (see above) for one turn per level of the caster. One creature per round can drink of the flow, but if it is used to fill leather canteen flasks, potion bottles, or other containers permitting transportation away for later imbibing, the spell is exhausted after 1 container/level of the caster is filled. Any container larger in volume than the caster's two hands placed together counts as two or more containers, depending on its size.\n\nThe second function of the spell allows the caster to clearly see through the spring's water to find creatures therein and examine submerged objects or the streambed itself. Normally invisible creatures in the spring affected by spring mastery are made evident to the caster by the spell's magic even if they are merged with the water as water weirds or water elementals are. Spring mastery used in this fashion permanently banishes all taints, poisons, waterborne diseases, and corrosive substances, including monster secretions. An aquatic monster employing such fluid or fluidborne attacks discovers that they simply do not function within a 70-foot spherical radius of where the spell was cast for one full year after the round of casting.\n\nThe third function of spring mastery permits instantaneous travel for the caster and all nonliving worn, carried, or held items only (to whatever limits the caster can normally carry) from the place of casting to either a known, previously visited spot in or on the banks of any other spring in Faerun (including subterranean watercourses) or to the nearest junction with another watercourse either upstream or downstream (which need not be a locale known to the caster), as the caster chooses.\n\nThe material component of this spell is three drops of water blessed by Eldath, blessed by one of her personal servants (her servitor creatures) in her name, or consecrated to her by an Exalted of Eldath. These must be poured upon the spot where the priest desires a spring to issue from in the first spell use, introduced into the existing spring in the second, or poured in the hand of the casting priest in the third.\n\nNotes: Granted by Eldath, the Green Goddess of the Forgotten Realms setting."

The sword inflicts 4d4 points damage, and the hammer deals 2d4 points. If they both attack the same target, there is no saving throw to avoid the damage they inflict, but a creature facing only one of the spell weapons is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to suffer only half damage.\n\nThe weapons are considered sufficiently enchanted to hit any sort of foe (such as those hit only by weapons of +3 enchantment). They automatically continue to attack the same target they did on the previous round if the caster is slain, departs, or turns his or her attention to other spellcasting. (When such a spell is finished being cast, the caster may return his or her attention to the sword and hammer and reassign them to other targets if desired.)\n\nThe magical constructs created by sword and hammer strike silently, are nonmetallic, cannot be fooled by illusions, and cannot be magically controlled by anyone other than the caster.

Within its confines, all points of damage done to foes by the attacks of lawful good-aligned beings are gained as extra (or replace lost) hit points by the attacking lawful good beings. Moreover, all edged weapons wielded against lawful good individuals strike at a -3 penalty on attack rolls and a -3 penalty to every die rolled for damage rolls (for example, 2d6+3 becomes 2d6+3-6). The caster can choose to make the swordward fill any area between 5 and 60 square feet, but its potency is unaffected by the size of its coverage.\n\nA swordward cannot coexist with a blade barrier. If either spell is cast so as to come into contact with any part of the area of effect of the other, both spell effects vanish instantly in a thunderous explosion, and all beings in the former areas of effect of both spells take 6dl2 points of blast damage; this damage is halved if they make a successful saving throw vs. spell. All items in the same area in such an event must make successful item saving throws vs. magical fire or be destroyed. Any beings located in the overlap area where the two spells met are allowed no saving throw, and items in that area must make successful saving throws vs. disintegration, not magical fire.\n\nThe material components of a swordward are an edged weapon or a fragment of a blade from an edged weapon that has drawn blood in battle, a piece of lodestone, and an amethyst of at least 5 gp value.\n\nNotes: Granted by the war god Torm of the Forgotten Realms setting."

The tentacle can grasp or manipulate objects (at a -2 penalty from the caster's normal Dexterity), wield weapons (at a -2 penalty to attack rolls), constrict for 1d8 points of damage plus 1 point per level of the caster in a round, or enact its withering power (if the caster wills it to): sucking life energy from a living body it is touching. To wither, the tentacle must make a successful attack roll at the caster's THAC0 plus a +4 bonus. A successful withering attack causes the victim 1d8 points of damage plus 1 point per level of the caster and the loss of sensory or motive use of the struck body part for one round with no saving throw. (Determine which body part is struck through random dice roll between possible targets.) If the head is struck, a round of blindness and deafness inescapably results. If a leg is struck, that leg cannot move for one round. A struck arm cannot move or hold things and drops anything already in its grasp. The tentacle can repeatedly affect a victim, inflicting another 1d8 points of life-draining damage plus 1 point per level of the caster each round and disabling a new limb or the same limb—if it can maintain contact with the being.\n\nThe caster can end this spell early at any time by silent act of will, causing the tentacle to melt slowly away. While the tentacle is disappearing, the caster does not have any use of the tentacle/limb for one round. While the tentacle is in existence, the caster cannot engage in other spellcasting and may have limited mobility or be hampered in some activities.\n\nThe material components of this spell are a fragment of bone or small complete bone and a piece of rubber or eel flesh.\n\nNotes: Granted by Moander the Darkbringer of the Forgotten Realms setting."

Undeath after death is cast on worshipers of Bane upon the moments of their deaths, transforming them into different forms of undead. Which form of undead a Banite becomes depends on his or her level of experience in life. The more powerful the Banite was in life, the stronger the type of undead. Vampires created by this spell retain character abilities. (If the DM chooses to use the optional rules presented for mummies in Van Richten's Guide to the Ancient Dead, mummies created by this spell retain character abilities, also.) The level of the caster must be higher than the level of the spell's recipient, or the caster must make a saving throw vs. death magic or perish in the casting. In such a case, however, the spell still acts normally on the recipient.\n\nThis spell is used only on Banite victims who are about to die (0 hp) or who have died (below 0 hp, or below -10 hp if that optional rule is in use). If the spell is cast upon a Banite after his or her death, it must be cast within one round per level of the caster after death occurs; otherwise, the spirit of the Banite is too far from the body to return and take control. If the caster waits too long, the spell works as an animate dead spell, creating a mundane, mindless zombie.\n\n!

A large body of water must be present (in other words, a pond, lake, or the sea) or the spell is wasted; the magic cannot create water. A waterspout created by means of this spell is 10 feet across, rises 80 feet above the water, and requires a depth of water of at least 20 feet beneath it. If sufficient space is not available for the spout to form, the spell is wasted. If it later encounters insufficient depth after it has formed, it collapses, inflicting 4d6 points of falling damage to all beings within it as the only damage it deals in that round and ending the spell.\n\nA waterspout is a destructive vortex of water which flails and sucks in creatures and objects it contacts and waterborne items within 10 feet of itself (below and on all sides), whirling them up to its top before flinging them free. The caster can direct the waterspout to travel horizontally 10 feet per round. It will claw along the sides of large immobile objects such as castle When the spell expires, it sinks slowly down, doing no harm to creatures and items it is carrying that round.\n\nItems struck by a waterspout must make item saving throws vs. crushing blow once per round or be shattered and destroyed. Structures and larger items may well suffer structural damage as determined by the DM.\n\nCreatures struck by a waterspout are sucked into it the first round. They are then helplessly whirled about for 6d8 points of damage per round for two rounds; they must also make a successful saving throw vs. death magic each round or drown unless able to breathe in water by natural or magical means or hold their breath (a successful Strength and Constitution ability check each round or a successful swimming proficiency check each round. Finally, they are flung free at the end of the next round, taking only 3d8 points of damage during this round. (They need not make saving throws vs. death magic this round.) Being flung free typically hurls a creature 100 feet or more horizontally (in the midst of a mist of water) and bestows 6d4 points of falling damage on creatures if they land in water or a swamp or as much as 12d4 points of damage if they are hurled into trees, buildings, rocks, or other solid objects. Items still miraculously attached to a flung creature's body must make a successful saving throw vs. crushing blow when their wearer lands or be destroyed; magical items receive a +2 bonus to this saving throw. Only on the round of being flung free is a creature able to use magical means, such as an item or quick spell, to escape the effects of the waterspout.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a drop of water blessed by Umberlee or by a senior Umberlant in the name of the goddess.\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil sea goddess Umberlee of the Forgotten Realms setting."

Each of these \"extra\" spells can be unleashed by silent act of will with a casting time of 1 and no need for material components. Casting these spells does not allow the priest to exceed the normal casting limitations of one spell being enacted in a round, however. If the caster so desires, one of the recalled spells can precisely duplicate in efficacy (hit points of damage done, area of effect, etc.) the original spell from which the recall copied its phantom spells or—if this exact duplicate is the second recalled spell to be unleashed—its recalled twin.\n\nA priest may only carry in mind one cast wondrous recall (that is, two phantom spells) and one uncast wondrous recall at a time. Prayers for more than one wondrous recall are never granted and attempts to cast a irondrous recall while one is still in effect result in the caster being feebleminded (as the 5th-level wizard spell of the same name).

The cloud issues forth chain lightning on the third round after it is created, the sixth round, and the ninth round. On the tenth round, the spell expires abruptly in a normal lightning bolt (1d6 points of damage per level of the caster to a maximum of 10d6 points).",
        "Priest's Spell Compendium": "This spell is similar to the winds of Akadi spell, except it emits chain lightning every third round as the 6th level wizard spell. A 30-foot-diameter Akadi's Vortex sphere of whirling air comes into existence at a point indicated by the caster. Creatures in the area of effect, or entering while the spell is in effect, must make a successful saving throw vs. spell or suffer 1d4 points of damage from the winds.\n\nEvery third round (3rd, 6th, and 9th). the cloud releases one chain lightning bolt in a manner and at a target selected by the caster. While directing the initial strike of the bolt, the priest loses his or her normal action for the round.\n\nThe chain lightning stroke inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster to a maximum of 12d6 points. The bolt initially inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 12d6 (half damage if the object or creature rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell). After the first strike, the lightning arcs to the next nearest object or creature. Each jump reduces the strength of the lightning by 1d6. Each creature or magical object hit receives a saving throw vs. spell. Success on this save indicates the creature suffers only half damage from the bolt.\n\nThe lightning can strike as many times (including the First object or creature) as the spellcaster has levels, although each creature or object can be struck only once. Thus, a bolt cast by a 12th level wizard strikes up to 12 times, causing less damage with each strike. The bolt continues to arc until it has struck the appropriate number of objects or creatures, until it strikes an object that grounds it (interconnecting iron bars of a large cell or cage, a large pool of liquid, etc.), or until there are no more objects or creatures to strike.\n\nDirection is not a consideration when plotting chain lightning arcs. Distance is a factor – an arc cannot exceed 40 yards, plus 5 yards per caster level. If the only possible arc is greater than the this, the stroke fades into nothingness. Creatures immune to electrical attack can be struck, though no damage is taken. It is possible for the chain to arc back to the caster!\n\nAffected creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell for half damage. Creatures within the cloud in a round when lightning is projected make their saving throws with a -4 penalty.\n\nOn the tenth round, the spell expires abruptly in a normal lightning bolt (1d6 points of damage per level of the caster to a maximum of 10d6 points. save vs. spell for half damage).\n\nNotes: Granted by the elven air god Akadi."

(The only other church known able to cast a similar spell is that of Rillifane Rallathil, and he has refused its usage for over a century.)\n\nThe reverse of this spell, dismiss nature elemental, disperses a summoned nature elemental.\n\nThe material components for this spell are burning incense, soft clay, sulfur, phosphorus, water, sand, and a duly consecrated holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Restricted to priests of Chauntea in the Forgotten Realms setting; possibly available to priests of Rillifane Rallathil (not known to be granted in over a century). Optionally available to nature priests."

        "Introduction": "When this spell is cast, a clap of thunder sounds and a billowing cloud of smoke erupts from around the caster or at a spot within 10 yards of him or her. Within this cloud appears a flaming chariot pulled by two fiery horses. The chariot moves at MV 24, Fl 48 (D) and can carry up to nine man-sized creatures. The caster need not be among them. The chariot feels uncomfortably hot to approach, and merely touching one of the horses inflicts 3d8 points of fire damage, but boarding or touching the chariot does no damage. Anyone in the chariot may control its path by verbal command, causing the flaming steeds to stop or go, walk, trot, run, or fly, turn left or right, or rise or descend.\n\nThe vehicle and steeds can be harmed by water or by magical weapons. (One quart of water causes 1 point of damage.) The steeds and chariot are AC 2 and can be dispelled by inflicting 30 points of damage upon each of them. The steeds and chariot can be forcibly returned to the Elemental Plane of Fire by the use of such spells as dispel magic and holy word. Fire and electricity harm neither the chariot nor the steeds, but cold-, ice-, and water-based magic cause them double damage. Attempts to charm, sleep, or hold the fiery steeds are always unsuccessful. Bringing an alchemy jug or a decanter of endless water into the death chariot causes the chariot to explode immediately for the effects given below.\n\nA death chariot closely resembles a chariot of Sustarre, save that its enchantments are less stable and more temporary. The caster may set the spell to work one of two ways: Either the death chariot is preset to explode at any time from one round to the end of one turn after the spell is cast, or the caster may retain detonation control of the chariot by accompanying it in person. This control does not preclude the caster from taking other actions or casting spells and does not mean that the caster has to verbally \"steer\" the death chariot himself or herself. Note that a priest could well deceive others into thinking the death chariot is a chariot of Sustarre by touching passengers before they enter the death chariot and accompanying them.\n\nIf the death chariot is preset to detonate, then at the designated moment it suddenly explodes in a gigantic ball of fire and vanishes along with its steeds. All in the chariot or within 30 feet take 10d4 points of fire damage. (A successful saving throw vs. spell halves damage.) Passengers suffer a further 2 points of blast shock as oxygen is consumed in the blast, and air rushes back in to fill the void caused by it. If the chariot vanishes in midair, they also take falling damage unless magical items or spells afford escape.\n\nReadily combustible materials such as cloth, wood, paper, and oil are consumed in the blast; flaming oil damage should be added to the damage total for any chariot passenger carrying oil on their person. All other items— including scrolls and spellbooks—gain an item saving throw vs. magical fire to survive the blast. If items suffer a fall from a midair death chariot blast, they must also make successful item saving throws vs. fall or be destroyed.\n\nIf the casting priest accompanies the chariot, she or he causes the death chariot to explode by act of will, not verbal command. The caster could bail out before igniting the trap, ride the death chariot in safety for a short trip (for example, across a chasm or down from a cliff, tower, battlement, etc.) and then leave it as a fiery trap, or even send the aeath chariot back at a pursuing enemy before causing it to explode. The maximum duration of a death chariot if it is not detonated is one round per level of the caster. If kept for its maximum duration, the death chariot fades away harmlessly.\n\nThe material components of the spell are a small piece of wood, bark, or a handful of wood shavings, two holly berries, and a fire source at least equal to a torch.\n\nNotes: Granted by the nature god Silvanus of the Forgotten Realms setting."

        "Introduction": "The Risen Cult of Bane uses a special symbol created long ago with the direct assistance of the god Bane. Unlike other priestly symbols, the death symbol of Bane is extremely long-lasting; it lasts for one discharge per creature whose blood is used in its making. The casting of most death symbols of Bane involves the sacrifice of at least 30 creatures whose blood is mixed into a paste with ground black opal dust and diamond dust (no less than 5,000 gp value of each type of dust). (Only three drops of each creature's blood are required, though Banites usually kill whole creatures and use all their blood.) The symbol is drawn with this grisly paste.\n\nA death symbol of Bane vanishes, once cast, and glows only when activated. It can be detected by magics that allow the reading or detection of invisible things or writings. It cannot be activated by any creature bearing a holy symbol of Bane. Typically, it is cast on a door or portal. It is activated when any creature of the types whose blood was used in its creation who is not carrying a holy symbol of Bane touches the door or attempts to pass through the portal.\n\nWhen activated, it explodes outward in destructive, life-draining energy. Any being within 10 feet of the death symbol of Bane must make a successful saving throw vs. death magic or be slain. (Any being touching the death symbol itself, even if using a weapon or tool to do so, saves at a -1 penalty.) Any being within 20 feet must make a successful saving throw vs. paralyzation or suffer a chilling withering that causes ldl 2 points of damage; there is a 30% chance that 1 hit point of such damage is permanently lost. Any being within 40 feet must make a successful saving throw vs. breath weapon or be wracked by fierce stabbing pains for 2dl0 rounds. These cause —2 penalties to victims' attack rolls as well as a -1 penalty on Dexterity ability scores.\n\nThese effects are cumulative. A creature touching a death symbol-guarded door or area has to save against all three effects each time the symbol is activated.\n\nIf a death symbol of Bane is cast upon a surface that is destroyed or broken before the death symbol is exhausted (usually in an attempt to destroy or bypass the death symbol), the death symbol's magical energy is instantly released in an explosion. This energy blast does 3d8 points of damage to all creatures within 10 feet, 2d8 points to all within 11 to 20 feet, 1d8 to all within 21 to 30 feet, and 1d4 to all within 31 to 40 feet.\n\nThe material component of this spell is the paste (described above) with which the symbol is drawn.\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil death god Bane of the Forgotten Realms setting."

This is a weightless instrument that can be \"hung\" in midair to allow the caster to cast other spells or engage in other activities. It can be banished by application of dispel magic, but only the caster can actually touch it, move it, or evoke its powers, which are awakened by plucking the harp strings. One string can be plucked per round, and each string holds only one power W and works only once, vanishing when called upon. When the last string fades away, so too does the spectral harp. The caster is always aware of which string calls forth what power. The normal selection of powers includes the ability to:\n\n\n * Shatter all nonmagical metal items within 20 feet of the harp.\n * Teleport all magical items within 40 feet of the harp to random locations in Faerun (not accompanied by anyone holding, carrying, or wielding them).\n * Unleash a lightning bolt from the harp, stabbing out at a single chosen target. (This causes 9d6 points of damage, and the target is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to reduce the damage by half.)\n * Teleport without error any beings specifically chosen by the caster who within 20 feet of the harp to a locale somewhere in Faerun chosen by the caster. (In other words, out of a group of struggling combatants, the caster could choose just his or her friends.)\n * Call down a flame strike (a 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-high vertical column of roaring flame) on a single target creature within 70 feet of the harp. (This causes 6d8 points of damage, and the target is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to reduce the damage by half.)\n\nThere are ways of varying the incantation of harp of war to give a harp slightly different powers from the norm. Each temple has its own variations. (Player-created custom variants must be approved by the DM.)\n\nThe most common variant of this spell is a harp that calls forth repulsion, wall of stone, wall of fire, and blade barrier spells, and instead of teleportation summons three angry pegasi that fight for the caster or provide transport for him or her and other chosen beings (or items) for up to 7 turns. (This latter version of the spell is the one used almost exclusively by faithful trained in Waterdeep and Athkatla.)\n\nThe material component of this spell is a thin strand of silver wire.\n\nNotes: Granted by Milil.

The maelstrom created by this spell is a destructive, descending vortex of water that sucks in creatures and objects, whirls them around and down, and thrusts them out of its bottom deep underwater. Waterborne items and creatures within 50 feet of the maelstrom's edge are drawn in to it at a rate of 10 feet per round until they enter the cone— whereupon they are whirled around and around, descending for four rounds before being expelled at the bottom on the fifth. The maelstrom is 60 feet deep and 120 feet in diameter.\n\nCreatures able to swim and boats being rowed or under sail can fight against the pull of the maelstrom, making Strength ability checks each round that if successful slow their progress into the cone to 5 feet. Vessels receive a Strength check based on a Strength score equal to that of their strongest rower plus 1.\n\nOnce drawn into the maelstrom and descending, creatures take 2d6 points of buffeting damage per round but travel in a fairly stable path. No spells requiring a material component can be cast, and only items already in hand can be used. On each round, descending creatures must make a successful saving throw vs. death magic or drown unless able to breathe water by natural or magical means or hold their breath (a successful Strength and Constitution ability check at a -1 penalty each round or a successful Swimming proficiency check at a -1 penalty each round).\n\nOn the fifth round (that of expulsion), the damage is doubled to 4d6 points, and the saving throw vs. death magic is made at a -2 penalty (-2 to holding one's breath). From the 60-foot depth at the center of the cone, the creature is expelled 40 feet downward and to one side. If a rocky bottom or any solid object is struck during this forcible journey, an additional 2d4 points of damage is taken. Thereafter, the being is free of the maelstrom's effects but is 100 feet below the surface of the water and will drown unless means of breathing in water are available or an immediate ascent is made. An ascending creature must succeed at three swimming checks or three sets of Strength and Constitution checks. If any of these rolls fail, Id4 points of damage are taken per failed roll.\n\nItems drawn into a maelstrom are buffeted and then expelled just as creatures are and must make successful item saving throws vs. acid for each of the four rounds of descent plus the round of expulsion or be destroyed. If they strike bottom when they are expelled, an additional item saving throw vs. crushing blow is forced upon the item. If it is failed, the item is destroyed. Buoyant items that survive all this slowly ascend to the surface. All others settle to the bottom wherever the maelstrom hurls them.\n\nWhen the spell expires, the maelstrom slows and becomes more shallow. Its central waters rise to the surface and carry all items and creatures up with them in an ascending, undamaging spiral. From the moment the spell expires, no damage is dealt by a maektrom; things not yet expelled from its bottom are borne back to the surface in the described manner.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a drop of water blessed by Umberlee or by a senior Umberlant in the name of the goddess.\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil sea goddess Umberlee of the Forgotten Realms setting."

        "Introduction": "This complicated evil ritual to magically veil moonwells was recently rediscovered and developed by certain priests of Bane. Moonwells are precious pools of clear water found in the Moonshae Isles sacred to the goddess Chauntea, known as the Goddess (or Earthmother) in the Moonshaes. Some sages and priests believe that this ritual could be modified to seal other existing gates, color pools, and other means of passing between planes or contacting deities.\n\nA moonveil spell is a long ritual involving chanting, dancing about the entire circumference or shore of a moonwell, and the sacrifice of one living creature per round. The caster may have up to seven assistants active in carrying out the ritual.\n\nIf successful, the spell causes a moonwell to lose its properties. In addition, any holy water or sweet water potions that are within 90 feet of the caster at any time during the ritual are fouled and useless. The moonwell may be magically purified again, but the other magical waters are ruined forever.\n\nA veiled moonwell is covered by an opaque black carpet of curling mist, even in full sunlight. This veil blocks all beneficial effects of the moonwell. It also lessens the local influences of the Goddess (Chauntea), preventing her from awakening or, if already active, from accurately directing her landdwelling children, Kamerynn the unicorn and the Pack, against evil.\n\nContact with the black mist forces items to make saving throws vs. acid with a -2 penalty or be destroyed and living beings to make saving throws vs. poison with a -2 penalty or suffer 3d4 points of corrosive damage per round of contact. If a being dives, falls, or is otherwise immersed in the pool, 6d4 points of damage automatically are inflicted for each round of contact, and the victim must make a successful saving throw vs. poison each round or be blinded. Such blindness lasts for Id4 turns after the being was last in contact with the mist or water.\n\nAll spells of 6th level or less directed against the black mist of the well are reflected back 100% for full effect on the caster. The black mist cannot be separated into smaller portions, nor can any of it be taken away from the well; the magic of the spell generates it continuously from the pool itself.\n\nA moonveil can be destroyed by a specially cast variant of the sunray spell, sanctify sacred site (a 7th-level priest spell of the church of Chauntea). No other means of destroying a moonveil has yet been found. It cannot be reversed or negated by the will of the caster.\n\nThe material components of this spell are a piece of burned bone from any creature native to the Moonshaes, the blood of one living creature per round of the ritual (each creature must be slain during the ritual), a pinch of dung, a pinch of ashes, a dried snakeskin, and a small vial of liquid poison.\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil god Bane of the Forgotten Realms setting."

Recipients of this spell lose all the negative aspects of old age, such as lost hit points, levels, or ability score points, and so on, as well as gaining immunity to all diseases for the duration of the spell only.\n\nThis spell functions only on characters who have shown exceptional wisdom and piety during their lives, and then only if they have an exceptional focus that their current condition prevents them from completing. Casting a quest spell is thus mandatory before attempting this spell. Dropping this quest means forfeiting all advantages of the resplendence spell.\n\nCharacters can benefit from this spell only once in a lifetime. When the spell expires, the recipient's body returns to the state it would have normally for its years. The spell heavily drains the body of the recipient, and so adds an additional 1d10+3 years to the recipient's true age when it expires.\n\nThis spell is one of the secrets of the church of Tyr and is used sparingly, only when it needs the help of a great hero in dire circumstances.

The two items must be fashioned of the same material(s) and be roughly the same size. They cannot be living creatures, and ideally they should be nearly identical (matching swords, scrolls, statuettes, etc.). The sacred link spell causes an invisible magical bond to be created between the two items. After the spell is cast, both radiate a very faint dweomer, and what befalls to one item also mystically happens to the other simultaneously, even if the two are separated by myriad planes or any distance. For instance, if a scroll joined to a duplicate by a sacred link is sold to an enemy and the match for it is retained, several ] days after the sale the retained copy could be burned and the enemy's copji would also be consumed, regardless of its location or situation. The link lasts until one of the items is destroyed or until a dispel magic by a caster of at least 15th level is cast upon one of the items, negating the link.\n\nBy means of this spell, a weapon could be damaged or destroyed by affecting its twin—or conversely, an item could be improved by plating with gold, adorning with gems, or careful carving. This spell can be used to link identical magical items. Recharging or activating one linked item would then identically affect the other, but there is a 1% cumulative chance per use of the link (which is involuntary and not under anyone's control once the spell is cast) that one of the items shatters or explodes (discharging all of its functions or charges) and ends the link.\n\nThe material components for this spell are the two items, the caster's holy symbol, and a strand of fine wire, human hair, or spider web.\n\nNotes: Granted by Tempus, war god of the Forgotten Realms setting."

        "Introduction": "This spell was developed in ancient times by druids of the Earthmother on the Moonshae Isles as is a variant of the sunray spell. Long forgotten, it was rediscovered through the research efforts of the wizard Flamsterd and the druids of the Moonshaes following the destruction of the Risen Cult of Bane by a small company of Harpers several years after the Time of Troubles. The druids employed this spell to mitigate the destruction inflicted by the cultists' moonveil spell, but it has additional powers as well.\n\nA sanctify sacred site spell takes nearly a full day to cast; it begins at dawn and ends at sunset. It is cast upon on a site sacred to Chauntea such as a sacred grove, moonwell, or graveyard of her followers that has been defiled by the forces of evil. The ritual of casting the spell involves chanting, dancing solemnly about the entire site, and the sacrifice of tokens of the goddess's bounty (the material components).\n\nSanctify sacred site is a form of faith magic that purifies corruption and evil from the land. It must be preceded by the casting of focus (a 4th-level priest spell). The base percentage of success is equal to the level of the priest who casts the spell. For every five true worshipers of Chauntea of any race who participate in the ritual as long as they are able (all day, or until death or total exhaustion), whether they be human, elf, korred, or faerie dragon, the chances of this spell succeeding in purifying a defiled sacred site are increased by 1%. Success is checked for at the moment of sunset. The chance of this spell succeeding is increased by 25% if it is performed on Midwinter or the vernal or autumnal equinoxes. If performed on Midsummer, the chance is increased by 40%.\n\nIf the spell succeeds, a dazzling beam of light erupts from the ground or water at the center of the sacred site to be sanctified. This beam has all the effects of a sunray (the 7th-levet priest spell) on any creatures of evil present within a 1-mile radius of the light, whether they be on the ground, in the air, or beneath the earth. Any defiling magic in effect on the sacred site, such as moonveil spell, is permanently dispelled, and any magical powers of the site lost to the defiling magic will slowly return if the faithful maintain their worship of Chauntea at the site.\n\nThe material components for this spell are varied and difficult to procure simultaneously. The goddess requires a spring sapling covered with dew to planted, a summer swan halfway between the gosling and adult stage to be released, a bushel of fresh fall harvest to be consumed, and ice crystals from the first winter frost to be placed at the center of the site.\n\nNotes: Granted by Chauntea, the Great Mother, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

However, the linked being can vanish into the book whenever desired.\n\nMaterialization and dematerialization both take 1 round. While within the book, the bound being can see, hear, and speak normally, but cannot move things, including the book, nor feel or move its body, clothing, or any carried items. A being spellbound in a book cannot be seen by those examining it by nonmagical means. The spellbound being can read the surface thoughts of anyone reading or flipping through the book (akin to the 2nd-level wizard spell ESP) if it concentrates on doing so.\n\nA spellbound being can freely leave the book it is linked to at any time unless other spells are cast upon the book to restrict this. While within the tome it need not rest, sleep, eat, or drink. All body processes, including healing, are suspended for the spellbound being while it is in the book.\n\nA successful dispel magic cast by a spellcaster of at least 20th level destroys the binding between book and being without damaging either. Utter destruction of the book ends the spell and deals the being it was linked to 4dl2 points of damage. The death of a spellbound being in turn forces an item saving throw vs. acid on the book to avoid its crumbling to dust forever. This disintegration takes three rounds and can be halted by a successful dispel magic spell, wish, or limited wish cast within this time.\n\nNotes: Granted by Oghma, Lord of Knowledge, in the Forgotten Realms setting."

        "Introduction": "This spell is used to link far-flung temples or sacred areas for important and emergency journeys. A stone walk is a special form of teleportation that circumvents all known magical barriers and safeguards against teleportation, including gorgon's blood, proof against teleportation spells, and so on.\n\nA stone walk involves two stony areas large enough to stand on. Both must be prepared with a secret ritual involving crushed gems before the spell itself is cast. Once the stone walk is cast, a being can pass instantly and unerringly from one stone to the other by standing on one and speaking a secret password set during the casting. The two ends of the teleportation must be on the same plane of existence but may be any distance apart. The trip itself is always instantaneous and safe, though the destination itself may be guarded, trapped, flooded, or the like. The traveler always arrives at the other end; blocking the stone transport site with solid matter merely causes the traveler to arrive at a nearby open, floored space.\n\nOne one-way trip per level of the caster may be made for one being (usually the caster, but not necessarily) and all carried or worn items, accouterments, and nonliving items of up to 100 lbs. in additional weight. Living creatures who touch the caster may also be transported along with 100 lbs. of gear each, but each creature plus 100 lbs. of gear uses up one trip. Nonliving material of more than 100 lbs. in weight is simply left behind and cannot stone walk without the touch (and accompaniment) of a living creature. Usually, only a single priest makes a trip, and the extra capacity of the spell is left for subsequent trips. Note that the password cannot be changed until the spell is exhausted and a new one cast to replace it.\n\nIf too many creatures try to come on a stone walk, the spell is exhausted. The caster or whoever speaks the password is first taken and then whichever other creatures the magic can accommodate. Extra creatures and all nonliving material in excess of the spell's capacity are left behind.\n\nThe material component of the preparatory ritual for the end sites of the spell is a paste with which each end of the stone walk is outlined. For each end, this paste requires four crushed rubies of at least 5,000 gp value each. The ends must be personally prepared by the caster of the stone walk within 444 days of the casting of the spell. The ritual of preparation involves the spellcaster bathing, thoroughly washing the stony areas selected, and outlining these areas with the paste while whispering the future password.\n\nThe caster can travel between the two end sites by any form of motivation desired (walking, flying, burrowing, riding a horse, etc.) and can cast the stone walk immediately after the second end is prepared.\n\nThe spell itself requires a piece of spider silk at least a foot in length, two intact diamonds of 5,000 gp value or greater, a handful of earth, and a wing feather of any flying bird.\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil god Bane of the Forgotten Realms setting."

It automatically scatters unprotected creatures with up to 3 Hit Dice, who must make a successful saving throw vs. death magic or be killed. It grounds all flying creatures, who must make a successful saving throw vs. death magic or crash, taking falling damage. Unprotected creatures with 4 or more Hit Dice take 3d6 points of damage per round of exposure from buffeting, flying debris, etc. and cannot move into the wind (in other words, toward the caster). The whirlwind has the same effect as an earthquake (see the 7th-level priest spell of that name) on all structures except those made of solidly constructed stone.\n\nThe whirlwind moves at a rate of 30 to 60 yards per round according to the desire of the caster, and the caster can vary its direction by up to 60 degrees per round. The caster must concentrate on the whirlwind for a full round to change its speed or direction.\n\nThe material components for this spell arc the priest's holy symbol and a piece of straw.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Air god Akadi of the Forgotten Realms setting and the elven air goddess Aerdrie Faenya."

The harp can appear anywhere the caster desires up to 10 feet per level distant. The caster has near total control over the initial position, movement, and playing of the harp. The powers of a harp cannot pass through magical barriers (such as a wall of farce), and a spellcaster cannot cause the harp to come into being beyond or to move through such a barrier.\n\nIf the caster is within 10 feet per level of the harp, she or he can move it up to 10 feet per round as willed. This movement does not require the caster's constant attention, and the caster may take other actions while the harp plays.\n\nThe tune or tunes that the harp plays are the ones the caster listed in mind during the spellcasting, and the harp plays them in order at normal tempo, repeating them from the beginning of the list when it complet es all tunes selected, until the spell's duration ends. The harp's playing can be turned on and off instantly and repeatedly by the silent will of the caster, and this does not affect spell duration. While the harp is playing, it has the following effects:\n * All normal sound is hushed (but not negated) and available light, even magical light, dims.\n * All creatures and objects with 60 feet of the harp are affected as if by a feather fall spell with no saving throws (rendering most missiles useless).\n * All creatures of 4+4 HD or less within 40 feet must make a successful saving throw vs. spell or be affected as if by a sleep spell.\n * All creatures with in 20 feet of the harp except the caster are slowed (no saving throw).\n\nMelisander's harp is unaffected by dispel magic or silence spells, nor can it be damaged by physical or magical att acks. A limited wish or stronger spell is required to dispel it before it expires normally. This spell is the priest version of the Melisander's harp spell presented in Pages from the Mages. The spell is named for its creator, the elf mage and Harper hero known to Realmslore as the Last Lonely Harp ist. Finder learned it and teaches it to his bardic followers, as well as granting its use to his church.\n\nThe material components of the is spell are a silver harp string and at least three tears from an elf, a maiden who sings, a harpist (or other musician), or the caster.

These effects do not return after the starharp fades away. In addition, the caster may concentrate on any one being within a 2-foot-diameter sphere per level of himself or herself during spellcasting. That being is magically cured of 2d4 points of damage as soon as the starharp appears. If no being is chosen, this healing power is lost; it cannot be saved for later.\n\nThis spell cannot be disrupted by attacks against the caster or the harp image. Magical darkness of any sort cannot form or persist within the starharps' area of effect.\n\nOnce the spell is cast, the creator of a starharp is free to fight, sleep, cast spells, and engage in other activities without affecting the starharp.

Mist is left behind at the caster's last solid corporeal location if the caster uses such spells as blink, dimension door, or teleport. The movement cannot be changed once chosen. Mist control does not prevent other action or spell casting.\n\nThe mist created is thick and concealing, obscuring even infravision beyond two feet. The mist is also extremely wet, dousing normal campfires or smaller flames and extinguishing larger normal fires in 2-5 rounds (this destroys the mists). Many wizards use this spell to put out house and forest fires.\n\nAll fire-based attacks entering, passing through, or cast within the mists lose 2 points from each die of damage.\n\nItems in the mist receive +3 saving throw bonuses against fire-based attacks, but damage done is unchanged. The mists can be affected by hold vapor and destroyed by dispel magic. Duration of the mists is halved by strong winds.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for Water, Air, and Weather mages; otherwise rare.

Unlike a fireball, it does not explode outwards to affect all beings in an area.\n\nFlamsterd's flamestrike ruins any ongoing spellcasting on the part of the victim and endangers any unprotected accoutrements, even when the victim is magically protected against fire.\n\nWhen used as a trap, a flamestrike must be cast on a small piece of metal (typically a piece of copper) and a series of specific triggering conditions (equivalent to those of a magic mouth spell) uttered. The trap is then \"set\" to activate when the conditions are met. It can be magically detected as a trap only if the detector is specifically considering an action that would trigger it.\n\nThe conditions typically involve disturbing the coin or piece of metal, and the flamestrike can wait indefinitely until the conditions are fulfilled. The conditions cannot involve anything involving detection of actions at a distance; that is, casting a specific spell or entering an area, if the coin is not disturbed by doing so, etc. If a dispel magic is cast on the coin before it is disturbed or any other of the preset conditions are fulfilled, the spell will be dispersed without taking effect. If one or more beings fulfill the conditions of a \"set\" flamestrike, the first one to do so is affected; if they do so simultaneously, the spell still affects only one being (determine randomly).\n\nThe material components are a pinch of saltpeter, filings or a small piece of any metal, a piece of phosphorous, and a pinch of ashes.\n\nNotes: Rare or very rare spell; originally from the Forgotten Realms setting."

Once it reaches its desired position and configuration (mentally selected by the spellcaster as the blood mantle is hurled), the curtain is immovable until the spell expires. In this form, the blood mantle acts as a wall of iron identical in effect co the barrier created by the 5th-level wizard spell wall of iron except chat it is impervious to the attacks of rust monsters and similar corrosion attacks, is much smaller in area of effect, and is of limited duration.\n\nThe material components of chis spell are a ruby or other red gemstone of at least 24 gp value and the priest's holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Granted by Garagos the Reaver, a war god of the Forgotten Realms setting."

All attacks by the target creature are made in a mad frenzy with no thought to tactics, personal risk, or the consequences of any action. Unlike a true berserker, the target of a blood rage spell has no ability to tell friend from foe. While under this spell's effects, a creature frenetically attempts to shed the blood of any being it encounters, moving from one opponent to the next based on proximity and noticeability. (For example, the target of a blood rage spell would ignore a pixie 5 feet away in lieu of attacking an ogre 10 feet away, but if the ogre was 50 feet away, the pixie would be attacked first.) Aside from the situations mentioned below, a blood rage spell ends only when the target goes three continuous rounds without a warm-blooded creature within 50 yards to attack.\n\nWhile in a blood rage, beings have phenomenal resistance to pain and some forms of magic. They are immune to the wizard spells charm person, friends, hypnotism, sleep, irritation, ray of enfeeblement, scare, geas, and similar incantations. They are immune to the clerical spells command, charm person or mammal, enthrall, cloak of bravery, symbol, and similar magics. They receive a +4 bonus to saving throws against the wizard spells blindness, Tasha's uncontrollable hideous laughter, hold person, charm monster, and confusion, and the clerical spells hold person and hold animal. The emotion spell has no effect unless the fear result is chosen. In that case, if enraged beings successfully save vs. spells, they are unaffected, but if they fail, the blood rage spell immediately ends. The effects of a finger of death spell, whether the saving throw is successful or not, are delayed until the blood rage ends. In addition, while in a blood rage, beings receive a + 1 bonus to their attack rolls, a + 3 bonus to damage, and 5 phantom hit points that are subtracted first when damage is suffered (and then disappear when the spell ends if not used).\n\nEntering a blood rage has numerous disadvantages as well: Targets of this spell have no real sense of how much damage is being taken. (The DM keeps track of how many hit points a being has left, not any player.) They cannot use ranged weapon and cannot cake cover from ranged missile fire. Spells such as bless, cure light wounds, aid, cure serious wounds, cure critical wounds, heal, and regenerate are delayed from taking effect until after the blood rage ends.

The effects of a spiritual corruption spell can only be ended by a limited wish or wish spells or the actions of a deity, artifact, or relic. Dispel magic and simi lar spells have no effect. The casting of this spell is an evil act.\n\nThe target of the spell is entitled to an initial saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effects of spiritual corruption entirely. Good-aligned beings receive a +4 bonus to their initial saving throw, neutral-aligned beings (with respect to good and evil) receive no bonus or penalty, and evil-aligned creatures are unaffected by this spell.\n\nOnce under the effects of a spiritual corruption spell, a victim's moral fiber is severely tested.\n\nWithin one day of the casting of this spell, a victim is tested by a minor moral dilemma, selected by the DM. If the victim fails a saving throw vs. spell (secretly rolled by the DM, and the above mentioned modifiers do not apply), she or he chooses the morally suspect option. If the victim succeeds at the saving throw, the victim is no longer under the effect of the spiritual corruption spell. Saving throws can, of course, be voluntarily forgone.\n\nIf the saving throw is failed on the first day, the victim is tested again by a more significant moral dilemma on the second day. Again a saving throw is required, this time with a -1 penalty. If the saving throw succeeds, the victim is tested again the following day by a less significant moral dilemma, but with no penalty to his or her saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the temptations increase, and a third test occurs on the third day, with a -2 penalty.\n\nThis series of temptations fluctuates in degree and penalty indefinitely until the victim either makes his or her saving throw on a day with no penalty or until the victim fails a saving throw vs. spell with a - 7 penalty. In the former case, victims are no longer under the effect of the spiritual corruption spell, but they still have to deal with the consequences of their moral failures and may need an atonement spell. In the latter case, the spell also ends, but the victim's alignment irrevocably shifts to evil (their alignment with respect to law and chaos remains unchanged), and they feel strongly drawn to the worship of Gargauth.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a piece of fruit that looks delicious on the outside, but which is completely rotten within.\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil demigod Gargauth the Outcast of the Forgotten Realms setting."

It lasts until the hand of Hoar has struck the spell's recipient or the recipient is dead.\n\nUpon casting the spell, the priest of Hoar must touch the spell's recipient and then verbally accuse the creature of some particular injustice committed that caused harm (DM's discretion) to some other creature or to the spellcaster. If the target fails a saving throw vs. spell, is actually guilty of committing the named injustice, and can understand the priest's accusation, then the spell takes effect. Note that the priest has no way of knowing if the spell has actually taken effect except to hypothesize if a fitting response occurs following the casting of the spell.\n\nThe vengeance of the hand of Hoar is swift and harsh. For example, if an assassin kills the wrong target and is then subject to the effects of Hoar's divine justice, it is likely the assassin will die while unintentionally foiling a rival assassin's attack on the original target. If a mage imprisons innocent rival and is then subjected to the effects of the hand of Hoar, it is likely that mage's next spellcasting attempt will take effect within the radius of a spontaneously-appearing wild magic region. The resulting miscast spell might result in the mage being imprisoned. The effects of the hand of Hoar vary on a case-by-case basis, and must be adjudicated by the DM, but should be suitably ironic—a punishment to fit the crime.\n\nThe material components of this spell are a small token once possessed by the one who committed the act of cruelty and the priest's holy symbol. Neither is consumed in the casting.\n\nNotes: Granted by Hoar the Doombringer of the Forgotten Realms setting."

In addition, if the recipient has recently failed a saving throw versus a fear effect during the current day, the spell immediately ends the effect if it is still ongoing. For every three levels of the caster, one creature can be affected by the spell (one creature at levels 1 through 3, two creatures at levels 4 through 6, etc.). This spell has no effect on undead.\n\nThe material component for this spell is a tuft of hair from a lion or related creature (including wemics, werelions, lammasu, etc.).\n\nNotes: Granted by Nobanion. the Lion King, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

When a roar of the king spell is cast, the caster acquires tremendous vocal powers similar to those of a male lion. The caster can emit an ear-splitting roar that has a principal effect in a cone shape radiating from his or her mouth to a point 40 feet away. Any creature with in the area of effect is deafened for 2d6 rounds and suffers 2d8 points of damage. A successful saving throw vs. spell negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half. An y exposed brittle or crystal substance subject to sonic vibrations is shattered by a roar of the king spell, while those brittle objects in the possession of a creature receive the creature' saving throw. Deafened creatures suffer a -1 penalty to surprise rolls, and those chat case spells with verbal components are 20% likely to miscast chem.\n\nA roar of the king spell cannot penetrate the 2nd-level priest spell silence, 15' radius. Unlike the related wizard spell, there is n limit to the number of times chis spell can be employed per day.\n\nFinally, a roar of the king spell can be heard a mile away, if not farther. No words can be communicated via this spell, but it is an effective way of alerting distant allies.\n\nThe material components for this spell are a drop of honey, a piece of cinnamon bark, a small piece of meat, and a small piece of amber worth at lease 20 gp.\n\nNotes: Granted by Nobanion, the Lion King, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

Any physical or emotional sensation can be heightened to unbelievable heights through the application of this spell, often disconnecting the recipient from reality, creating an extremely heightened interest or emotion, and proving to be an immense distraction from dealing with fast-paced and changing circumstances (such as in a combat situation). While this spell is in effect, all ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls (minimum I point of damage), and saving throws are made with a -2 penalty, and all wizard and priest spells are cast with a 1d4+ 1 casting time initiative penalty.\n\nAlthough normally employed in pleasurable situations, this spell can be used heighten pain as well to a potentially incapacitating level. Damage suffered during the effect of this spell is perceived as 25% (round up) worse than it actually is, although the spell has no effect on the actual damage inflicted. (Baically, add 25% to damage (rounding down) as phantom damage that goes away when the spell ends and that cannot kill a target, though it can render him or her unconscious.) As a result, the target may collapse into unconsciousness wracked by unbearable pain even if she or he could normally continue to fight on. Likewise spells such as whip of pain (both wizard and priest versions), symbol of pain, or pain touch have twice their normal effect (or if inapplicable, twice the duration).\n\nThis reverse of this spell, deaden sensation can be employed to suppress physical pain or other harmful feelings. While this spell is in effect, the recipient is immune to the effects of whip of pain, symbol of pain, pain touch, suggestion, other charm-type magics (and it terminates an existing charm), emotion, stunning, or nausea. All damage received while the reversed form of this spell is in effect is perceived a 25% less than actual, although the full effects are felt when the spell ends. (Reduce the damage by 25% (rounding up) but keep a total of the amount of points of damage held in abeyance. When the spell end, all unapplied damage is applied at once.) This dulling of pain can enable a Sharessin to fight on beyond normal unconsciousness (or death) for the duration of the spell, although the Sharessin collapses into immediate unconsciousness upon the spell's expiration if the damage would normally cause this effect and may die instantly if seriously enough injured.\n\nNotes: Granted by Sharess, the Tawny Temptress, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

By laying both hands on a pregnant female's belly (or above her womb), the Shiallian can ease labor pains, correct complications like a breech birth, and otherwise make labor as easy and painless as possible. No saving throw is required for this version of the spell and the spell's effect last throughout the birth process as long as the Shiallian maintains contact with the mother and/or child.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, inflict labor, afflicts the target with all the pains of labor. For the reversed form, the spellcaster need not maintain contact with the spell's target beyond the initial touch, which requires a successful attack roll to establish if the victim is not immobile, restrained, or unaware. Spell effects are split into three phases. The first two phases last three rounds each, and the final phase lasts one round per the caster's level to a maximum of nine rounds.\n\nIn the first phase, spell recipients feel violently nauseated and cannot cast spells, communicate, or attack. They can only defend themselves or move at half their normal movement rate.\n\nIn the second phase, spell recipients are fatigued and cannot perform any action requiring significant amounts of energy. Physical combat is not possible, nor is running, but spellcasting is possible, as is defending oneself or moving at a normal movement rate.\n\nIn the third phase, spell recipients suffer increasing amounts of pain. For each round this phase lasts, victims suffer increasing amounts of phantom hit point damage and a temporary loss of Strength. In the first round, the target suffers 1 hit point of phantom damage, in the second round 2 hit points, in the third round 4 hit points, etc. Strength drops at a similar rate (1 point, 2 points, 4 points, etc.). When Strength or hit points drop to zero, the victim falls unconscious for the rest of the spell's duration. Spellcasting, physical attacks, and movement are not possible during this phase.\n\nStrength and hit points lost to this spell are regained at the same rate they were lost after the spell ends. Males get no saving throw v. the reverse form of this spell, and female are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect only if they have given birth at least once previously. Pregnant creatures of any kind cannot be affected by inflict labor, as Shiallia's will forbids it.\n\nThe material component for this spell is an acorn.\n\nNotes: Granted by the goddess Shiallia, of the Forgotten Realms setting.

The spell operates in the same way as plant growth, otherwise.\n\nThe second use of the spell is often requested as a marital blessing. Again, the DM makes a saving throw based on the caster's level, and success indicate that any creature upon whom the spell is case who mate within 24 hour has a 95% chance to impregnate or become pregnant. Furthermore, the offspring inspired by this magic is certain to be delivered normally and in good health provided the mother remains healthy and uninjured. Note that factors such a old age and curse may influence the percentage chance of becoming pregnant, as may magic specifically geared to preventing such an occurrence or the unfortunate face of a being's inability to conceive due to peculiar magical factors. (For instance, many of Mystra's Chosen seem unable to conceive for unknown reasons.)\n\nShiallia knows if this magical blessing should not be performed and secretly informs her priest if this is so. Shiallia' priest then performs a nonmagical blessing very similar in form instead to prevent the couple from being embarrassed if the blessing was to be a public event.\n\nThe material component of this spell is any seed.\n\nNotes: Granted by the goddess Shiallia of the Forgotten Realms setting.

A noble bloodline is created by any culture (no matter how insignificant) that recognizes a class of nobility commonly passed on to blood relatives. This spell even ascertains noble bloodlines of cultures long forgotten and extinct. For example, if this spell is cast upon an orc, it might determine that the orc is a descendant of the kings of the Screaming Banshee tribe and that he is the third surviving son of the reigning monarch.\n\nBy means of this spell, the spellcaster can divine bloodlines for titles which have been actively held within 100 years per experience level. For example, if the last king of Athalantar reigned within the past 900 years, the spellcaster would have to be at least 9th level to recognize any noble descendants of that bloodline. Even though Elminster, last prince of the first royal family of Athalantar still lives, neither he nor anyone else has held that throne or considered them elves \"in exile\" for approximately nine centuries.\n\nIn cases where the spell target is a descendant of multiple noble bloodlines, the spellcaster can ascertain one such bloodline for every three experience levels. The order in which such bloodlines are ascertained is ranked first by proximity in terms of how close in line the spell target is to inheriting the corresponding title, second by the relative rank or importance of the titles, and third by whether a bloodline is active or dormant (that is, whether the culture or kingdom it is from is still extant or essentially extinct).\n\nThe material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Granted by Siamorphe the Noble of the Forgotten Realms setting."

This spell can only be cast upon a person who voluntarily enters into the service of another being (who is not necessarily the spellcaster) as a servant or bodyguard. No saving throw is necessary, as it only affects beings who voluntarily submit to the effects of the spell. (Creatures under any form of magical or psionic control or those that are not in their right minds cannot be affected by a loyal vassal spell.) During the casting of the spell, the spell recipient's liege-to-be must be named in sufficient detail to specify exactly which person shall serve in that role. More than one loyal vassal spell cannot be cast on a single recipient at the same time; subsequent spells automatically fail.\n\nWhile under the effects of this spell, a recipient is absolutely loyal to the master named during the casting of the spell, and she or he cannot even contemplate any form of betrayal or treachery. The spell does not enable the named master to control spell recipients as automatons, but enspelled vassals serve to the best of their ability, even giving their lives in service if appropriate. A vassal is loyal to a person, not the office, so deposing the reigning monarch and proclaiming one elf king does not result in a transfer of loyalty by any vassals loyal to the former king.\n\nIf the spellcaster or the named master of the spell recipient harms or attempts to harm the vassal by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast on the vassal, the loyal vassal spell is broken (although it is unlikely that vassals will immediately betray a master in the latter case).\n\nThe material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol, which is touched to the brow of the spell target during the casting.\n\nNotes: Granted by Siamorphe the Noble of the Forgotten Realms setting."

        "Introduction": "This spell is often employed upon the birth of a noble's heir, at a coronation, or upon the investiture of a noble's title. It can only be cast upon descendants. of a noble bloodline (as defined in the divine bloodline spell) upon their assumption of a noble title. A ceremony of divine investiture takes at least one turn to cast, but most Scions of Siamorphe extend the incantation for at least an hour.\n\nUpon the commencement of the casting of this spell, a willing recipient is bathed in a flickering nimbus of radiant light equal in effect to a faerie fire spell. The color of the radiance is selected by the spellcaster (often gold, silver, or some other color appropriate to the noble office) and lasts for the duration of the spellcasting. During the incantation, the priest is empowered to create pageantry appropriate to the event. Th e illusions created are similar to those of the 3rd-level wizard spell spectral force, but must be appropriate to the ceremony, as adjudicated by the DM. For example, if divine investiture is cast upon the crown prince during his coronation, the priest might evoke the shades of past kings who one by one step forward to lay their shadowy swords upon the prince's shoulders. When the royal crown is placed on the prince's head, the priest might evoke a dazzling burst of light coming from the crown that momentarily blinds all in attendance.\n\nIn addition to the pageantry of the ceremony of investiture, this spell create a lasting effect known as the legacy of Siamorphe. The legacy varies from recipient to recipient (and is determined by the DM, not the player) and seems to loosely correspond in power to the relative rank of the spell recipient. Typical legacies are: a +1 Charisma bonus with respect to the recipient's subjects, a + 1 bonus on saving throws vs. poison, a + 1 bonus to hit when wielding the ceremonial word of state, etc.\n\nUnwilling recipients of this spell may choose to forego its effects. This decision is irrevocable once made, regardless of whether the spell is accepted or foregone, and it must be made at the start of the spell's casting. (Infants and small children targeted by this spell are assumed to voluntarily accept its effects.)\n\nThe material components for this spell are a chalice of holy water and a small amount of dye laced with gold flakes. The latter is used to sketch the noble's heraldic device (or appropriate symbol of nobility) somewhere on the spell target's body prior to the casting. The holy water is then poured over the inscribed symbol during the ceremony and the sketched symbol then vanishes.\n\nNotes: Granted by the demipower Siamorphe. the Noble, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

The magical tether can be dropped if the caster wants to drop it, but otherwise it does not fall from the caster's grip. The magical tether cannot be positioned so as to cause damage to a living being, such as to strangle it.\n\nTypically this spell is case upon harpoons or other hurled weapons prior to hurling them in combat. If the weapon lodges in its target, the priest may be able to drag the target closer, and if it misses, the priest can easily retrieve it.

A fortitude of Uthgar spell has no effect on beings not formally inducted into the shaman's tribe.\n\nWhile under the effects of a fortitude of Uthgar spell, the recipient automatically passes all Constitution ability checks. In addition, the spell recipient receives a +2 bonus to all Strength and Wisdom checks. Finally, the recipient receives a + 1 magical defense adjustment, identical to (and cumulative with) the bonus received for a high Wisdom ability score, against magical spells that attack the mind such as beguiling, charm, fear, hypnosis, illusions, possession, suggestion, etc.\n\nThe spell lasts one day for every two levels of the caster (round up). A small token of the beast totem, such as a bear claw or raven feather, must be carried by th e spell recipient. If the token is lost for any reason during the normal duration of a fortitude of Uthgar spell, th e spell effect ends immediately.\n\nThe material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol (the shaman's sacred bundle).\n\nNotes: Granted by the barbarian demipower Uthgar of the Forgotten Realms setting."

In either case, a target creature that is hit must make a successful saving throw vs. spell or be charmed. If the priest makes a damaging attack, the creature receives a saving throw bonus of +1 for each point of damage suffered (however, a roll of “1” always fails). If this spell is used in conjunction with a shillelagh spell, the creature saves at a -1 penalty. The dweomer lasts three rounds plus one round per caster level, or until the priest scores a successful hit with the cudgel, whichever occurs first.\n\nA charmed creature remains so for 2d10 rounds. The creature regards the priest as a comrade, friend, or mentor, treating the priest with love and respect, and trusting him or her implicitly. If communication is possible, the charmed creature obeys the priest to the best of its ability as long as the instructions seem plausible and do not obviously consign the creature to needless injury, loss, or violation of alignment.\n\nThis spell is particularly useful for getting incorrigibles to listen to the teachings of St. Cuthbert or to contribute to worthy causes.\n\nNotes: Granted by St. Cuthbert of the Cudgel of the WORLD OF GREYHAWK setting."

The spirit takes form as a transparent being, a combination of totem beast and primitive human. To select the type of spirit summoned, the DM rolls 1d20 and matches the result against the table below. The shaman can also try and summon a normal spirit (a minor spirit of the dead), such as a father or child of a tribal member. (These normal spirits may not leave the vicinity — no more than 50 feet — of the ancestral mound where they were buried.)\n\nWhen the spirit appears, the summoner makes a Wisdom ability check (using the table's modifiers) to control it; otherwise, the spirit becomes an uncontrolled ghost (use the ghost statistics in the MONSTROUS MANUAL tome) and immediately attacks all living beings around it. However, even an uncontrolled spirit cannot travel more than 50 feet from the ancestral mound.\n\nA controlled spirit may perform the following functions for a shaman: attack a foe (as a ghost—or another type of undead creature at the DM's discretion), guard the ancestor mound for a year (until freed again at the next Runemeet), tell the shaman ancient secrets, initiate a new shaman (only ancestral shaman spirits may do this), or raise dead (refer to the table).\n\nThe material components of this spell are the priest's holy symbol (the shaman's sacred bundle), a relic of the desired ancestor (though another may appear), and a small bonfire.\n\nNotes: Granted by the barbarian demipower Uthgar of the Forgotten Realms setting.",
        "Spirit Summoning Table": "If a specific normal ancestor (a minor spirit of the dead) is summoned rather than a special spirit from the table, roll 1d20. If the result is 15 or less, the desired spirit comes and the control roll modifier is -5.\n\n\n * * These spirits function as minor or major spirits of the dead (DM's discretion). These spirits may not leave the vicinity (no more than 50 feet) of the ancestral mound where they were buried.\n * ** Only these spirits can perform a raise dead spell. They function as great spirits of the dead. In payment for this, the spirit drains 1d2 experience levels from the person being raised and may demand an annual tribute of riches co be buried in or near its comb. These spirits may not leave the vicinity (no more than 50 feet) of the ancestral mound where they were buried.\n * † This is the ghostly form of the beast totem great spirit. It can remain for a number of days equal to the level of the shaman. Unlike an ancestor spirit, it may leave the vicinity of the mound. Each day, it can bestow the tribe's beast power on a number of followers equal to the summoner's level minus the number of days it has remained on the Prime Material Plane.\n * ‡ The beast totem great spirits are wild primeval spirits. If summoned, one usually possesses the summoner (or someone nearby) and then decides what to do with its newfound physical form. The possessed body becomes a 20th- level fighter (for hit points and attack rolls) with the spells and abilities of a 20th-level druid. The avatar of the beast totem great spirit can assume the beast form or use the tribe's beast power at will."

Unlike a quest spell, a spirit quest may only be cast upon a willing recipient and the spellcasting shaman cannot specify the nature of the quest or the requirements of the task in any fashion. Instead, the totem spirit of the beast cult communicates the spirit quest to the spell recipient through an ongoing series of cryptic dreams and mystifying visions. The spell recipient must interpret the visions and attempt to complete the quest. If the visions indicate that certain companions are allowed to join the quester on his or her spirit quest, then they (and only they) can participate without afflicting the spell recipient with the penalties of a standard quest spell.\n\nIf the spell recipient admits failure and gives up the spirit quest at any time, the effects of the spell end immediately and the carried token (described below) crumbles into dust. The quester suffers no further effects, except a loss of scarus in the tribe. However, if a quester succeeds, she or he becomes a legend among the children of Uthgar and receives a permanent, unique power granted by his or her tribe's totem spirit. (This unique ability must be designed by the OM and should be commensurate for the difficulty and importance of the spirit quest performed. In addition, the successful completion of a spirit quest should be marked by the granting of a large experience point reward.)\n\nNo being may attempt a spirit quest more than once per lifetime, regardless of the success or failure of a previous attempt.\n\nThe spell requires that the quester carry a small token of his or her beast totem, such as a bear claw or raven feather. If the token is lost for any reason before the spirit quest is completed, the visions cease immediately, although the requirements of the quest aspect of the spell remain in force.\n\nThe visions resume if and when the token is recovered.\n\nThe material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol (the shaman's sacred bundle) and a bundle of potent herbs and incense that is burned while the spell is cast.\n\nNotes: Granted by the barbarian demipower Uthgar of the Forgotten Realms setting."

By means of assume undead form, spellcasters can turn themselves into any type of undead they are familiar with of 8 HD or less that they could possibly turn if of six levels lower in experience than their current level. Hence a 7th -level priest could assume the form of a skeleton, zombie, ghoul, shadow, or wight, and an 8th-level priest could assume any of those forms as well as that of aghast. The only difference in abilities between spellcasters using assume undead form and true undead creatures is that no victims can arise as undead creatures as a result of a spellcaster's attacks while assuming the form of an undead creature. Hence if the spellcaster assumes the form of a wight and then drains all of the life energy levels of an opponent, the opponent does not later arise as a half-strength wight under his or her control.\n\nWhile in undead form, the caster cannot use spells or employ any other granted powers, spell-like abilities, or other special abilities. Hit points, Intelligence, and Wisdom are unchanged, but otherwise the spellcaster acquires the strengths and weaknesses of the assumed form including immunities to certain spells, if any. Any hit points lost while in undead form are not regained upon reversion to the original form.\n\nThis spell does not work for undead spellcasters.\n\nThe material component for this spell is a small piece of bone or flesh from the body of being who is now undead.",

        "Introduction": "This manifestly evil spell is a variant of the death pact spell from the Complete Book of Necromancers. This powerful pact has enabled many \"slain\" priests to return from the dead and eliminate their enemies.\n\nBy completing this ritual, a Velsharoan priest forge a powerful pact with Velsharoon the Vaunted. The covenant ensures that a chosen individual will survive an untimely death. A Velsharoon's death pact is triggered whenever the protected individual is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points (mortally wounded) due to combat, spell, or accident. In the same round, the subject receives the following benefits.\n * The individual (or his or her remains) and all possessions are transported immediately back co a religious sanctuary as if by a word of recall. The location of the sanctuary muse be specified at the time of forging the Velsharoon's death pact.\n * Upon arrival, the individual receives a raise dead spell (if necessary) and automatically succeeds at any required system shock survival roll.\n * Any severed or amputated limb are instantaneously regenerated.\n * The body is cleared of lingering enchantments with a dispel magic (bestowed at character's level), whether beneficial or baneful, and cleaned of all poisons, disease, blindness, curse, and insanity.\n\nA Velsharoon's death pact remain in effect indefinitely until the conditions established at the time of its forging have been fulfilled. The pact may be established to benefit an individual other than the caster. The chosen one must be in good standing with the Velsharan faith and is most commonly a member of the clergy who has reached 9th level and is undergoing the Pact of the Everlasting ceremony. Velsharoon's death pact must be cast in an unholy sanctuary conecrated to Velsharoon to be effective. A dispel magic can not end a Velsharoon's death pact prematurely.\n\nThis powerful spell is not without its costs, however. Forging a death pact is an exhaustively stressful process, drawing the casting priest (and the spell recipient, if other than the caster) into draining audiences with. extraplanar powers. As a result, establishing a Velsharoon's death pact ages the caster five year and requires at least one week for complete recuperation for the spell's caster and recipient, during which time the priest cannot case any spells or engage in any physically demanding activity. Furthermore, when the pact is invoked, the mystical transport and instantaneous healing exacts another to all, this time aging the recipient for five years (if the individual was raised, she or he also loses 1 point of Constitution permanently). This cost can be mitigated through the sacrifice of good-aligned sentient creatures in Velsharoon's name at the end of the spellcasting. For each such creature sacrificed, one year of aging caused by the spell is negated first from the caster of the spell and then from the aging penalty to be applied co it recipient when the spell's activation conditions are met. Finally, for each such creature further sacrificed, the week of recuperation is eliminated for first th e spell' caster and then the spell' recipient.\n\nThe spell's material components are seven drops each of the caster's blood, the recipient's blood, unholy water, and dew.\n\nNotes: Granted by the god Velsharoon the Lich Lord of the Forgotten Realms setting."

As with the continual light and continual darkness spells, this spell can be cast into the air, onto an object, or at a creature. In the third case, the continual shadow affects the space about 1 foot behind a creature that successfully rolls its saving throw vs. spell; a failed saving throw means the continual shadow is centered on the creature and moves as it moves. If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed in a light -proof covering, the spell effects are blocked until the covering is removed.\n\nContinual shadow brought into an area of magical darkness or magical light cancels the light or darkness so that otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect. A direct casting of a continual shadow spell against a similar or weaker magical light or magical darkness cancels both.\n\nThis spell eventually consumes the material it is cast upon, but the process takes far longer than the time in a typical campaign. Extremely hard and expensive materials might last hundreds or even thousands of years.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Chultan god Eshowdow of the Forgotten Realms setting."

Only a few of the most remote and insignificant Eshowe clans are completely untouched by this incantation's ta int.\n\nBy means of this spell, the recipient's shadow is permanently bound into his or her body and spirit. Thereafter, the recipient of a summon shadow spirit spell never again naturally creates a shadow, regardless of the immediate light conditions. The subject of a summon shadow spirit spell receives a saving throw vs. spell at a +1 bonus, modified by his magical defense adjustment due to Wisdom, to avoid this spell's effects unless the saving throw is voluntarily forgone.\n\nAlthough the Eshowe believe that a being's spirit is restored to its body by means of this spell, in truth this incantation binds a shadow (as described in the MONSTROUS MANUAL tome) that dwells on the Negative Material Plane to the recipient. Th is link transfers many of the shadow's natural defenses to the recipient. A recipient is immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells and cold-based attacks. Opponents require a +1 or better magical weapon to wound a recipient of this spell.\n\nHowever, this spell also has numerous insidious effect on the target. Th e binding of the shadow causes a slow, but inexorable, shift in alignment in the target to chaotic evil.

(The mind-affecting magic cannot be structured so as to prevent the casting of a free will spell if conditions permit.) The decision whether or not to cast the free will spell must be made before any saving throws are rolled or magic resistance is checked. Casting a free will spell in this fashion counts as the priest's action for the current round.\n\nNotes: Granted by the jungle god Ubtao of the Forgotten Realms setting."

Every other round, beginning the round after the spell is cast, the bird of prey dives down upon the spell target. It attacks with the spellcaster's base THAC 0, with a +2 bonus to hit, and has a +3 initiative bonus over the initiative rolled by its caster in a round. (Thus, if the casting priest or the casting priest's group rolled an initiative of 5, the bird of prey would have an initiative of 2.) If the phantom bird of prey strikes its intended target, it inflict 2d4+2 point s of damage. Whether it hits or misses, it immediately circles back upward and prepares for another attack until the spell effect expires. When possible, the bird of prey likes to climb to 30 to 40 feet above the spellcaster, though such a height is not necessary for the spell to function. The intended target of a bird of prey cannot be changed once the spell is cast, and the spellcaster need not concentrate to maintain the effect. The target of the spell need only be in range when the spell is cast; if the target being moves out of range using normal movement while the spell is in effect, the bird of prey continues its pursuit.\n\nWhile a bird of prey can be perceived as a hawk-shaped shimmering region by those who look carefully, attacks against it have no effect. Only a dispel magic or similar incantation affects a bird of prey, ending the spell immediately. Otherwise, the only way to escape the attacks of a bird of prey is to employ blink, dimension door, teleport, or other forms of magical travel. If the intended target escapes in such a fashion, the bird of prey automatically looses track of its target and immediately dissipates. Invisibility offers no protection, assuming the spellcaster could detect the target to begin with. Shield spells do not negate a bird of prey, but they cause it to automatically miss while they are in effect.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Mulhorandi god Anhur of the Forgotten Realms setting."

If they succeed ac their saving throws, they are thrown to the ground and take only 1d8 points of damage.\n\nBuildings, mine walls, and other structures take 2 points of structural damage from an earth shake spell. If a building or a targeted part of a building suffers full structural damage, it is thrown down in rubble. The average structural point value for several different types of buildings and parts of building s is given below.\n\n\n * * All buttresses must be destroyed before what they support (a wall, a tower, etc.) takes damage.\n * ** For tower roughly 20 to 40 feet high and from 10 feet to 30 feet in diameter (exterior measurements), not including buttresses.\n * ✝ For tower roughly 20 to 40 feet high and from 10 feet to 30 feet square (exterior measurement s), not including buttresses.\n * ‡ This category is most often used to destroy part of a larger structure such as a castle or outer wall. To cause a section of wall to crumble, the wall must take enough structural damage to destroy it entire height, not just the bottom or top 10-foot section.\n\nEarthshake can also be cast as a cooperative spell. If multiple priests cast this spell simultaneously on !he same area, the structural damage caused by each spell is multiplied by the number of casters participating. For example, three priest of Geb casting this spell could each inflict 6 points of structural damage (tot al 18), while four priests could each inflict 8 points of structural damage (total 32). A maximum of five Gebbite priests may cooperate in casting this spell (for a total of 50 points of structural damage in one area at once).

It enables the spellcaster to become more powerful and commanding.\n\nWhen cast, right of might increaeses the Strength of the spellcaster by 1d6 points (or tenths of points after 18 Strength is attained if the spellcaster is a martinet or is also a warrior). This spell cannot confer a Strength of 19 or more, nor is it cumulative with other magic that adds to Strength.\n\nThis spell also causes the spellcaster and any equipment carried to grow by up to 10% per four levels of the caster (round down), in creasing this amount in height, weight, and width. Hit points, Armor Class, and attack rolls do not change, but damage rolls increase proportionately with size. For example, a priest at 120% of normal size hits with a mace and rolls a 6 for damage. Th e adjusted damage roll is 8 (that is, 6x l. 2= 7.2, rounded up).\n\nBonuses due to Strength (except as noted above), class, and magic are not altered.\n\nFinally, this spell enables the priest to command another creature with a single word, with identical effects to the 1st-level priest spell command. One such command can be issued for every three levels of the priest (rounding up) to a maximum of six. Only one command may be issued per round and commands may be issued at any time while the right of might spell is in effect. It is not necessary to employ all the available command effects, but on the utterance of the last available command, the right of might spell automatically ends, even if the spell duration is not yet finished.\n\nThe material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Mulhorandi demigod Gilgeam of the Forgotten Realms setting."

For the rest of its life the subject of this spell looks upon the priestess as its mother, and the priestess looks upon the creature as her child. The depth and intensity of this relationship vary as is appropriate for the species of the infant. After the casting of this spell, any water mixed with milk fed to the infant creature by the hand of the priestess serve as the appropriate form of nourishment for the infant or child, even if the creature does not normally drink milk. (For example, the mixture of water and milk has the effect of regurgitated meat for a fledgling falcon.) This effect ends once the creature achieves full growth for its species, whereupon its diet and the composition of its food must be as is normal for the adults (or adolescents) of its species.\n\nThis spell has numerous indirect effects as well. Th e creature always views the priestess as if under the effect of an animal friendship spell. Any attempt to train the creature is very likely to succeed, as adjudicated by the DM. If the creature is of low intelligence or greater, the priestess can potentially make a significant impact on the creature's alignment. For example, an ore or a dire wolf raised by a priestess of Hathor might very well be considered neutral good upon reaching adulthood.\n\nHathor does not grant this spell to a priestess who already has enough parent al responsibilities. If a priestess abuses the parental relationship in any fashion, the creature's bond is transferred to the nearest available priestess of the faith, and the original spellcaster is stripped of all her powers until he suitably atones for her betrayal. Regardless, Hathor never grants this spell couch a priestess again.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a baby rattle.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Mulhorandi goddess Hathor of the Forgotten Realms setting."

It can only be case in a community, and at least 90% of the female inhabitant of that community must participate for it to have any effect. (This restriction effectively prevents the use of this spell in Mulhorand's cities.) Male members of a community are welcome to participate, as are outsiders, but nonresidents cannot number more than 5% of the participants. A dance of life cannot be performed more than once per year in a community.\n\nAll participants dance in a ring in a leaping, chaotic, free-form dance for an hour, at which point the y collapse exhausted and exhilarated. Even the old, crippled, and the infirm find they can participate, magically invigorated by Hathor's power.\n\nThis spell affects the general health of the community as well as the participants. Everyone participating in the dance is cured of all diseases (with the exception of magical disease such as mummy rot or lycanthropy) and receive the benefit of a cure light wounds spell and a neutralize poison spell. At the conclusion of the dance, the participants find themselves fully nourished and full. Beings who have suffered a decline in their physical abilities (Strength, Constitution, or Dexterity) due to aging find themselves restored to the vigor of youth for the remainder of the day. The community is cleaned of any pestilence and morale is raised to at least 12 (Steady) or increased by 2 if already at 12 or above (maximum 20).\n\nThis spell has been employed by priestesses of Hathor in the villages of Mulhorand for centuries. The requirement for female participation, however, effectively prevents its use in the cities of Mulhorand.\n\nThe material component of this spell is several gallons of milk spilled on the ground at the center of the dance prior to the beginning of the spell.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Mulhorandi god Hathor, in the Forgotten Realms setting."

        "Introduction": "This spell has two distinct uses, one of which must be chosen during spellcasting.\n\nIn its primary form, a test of maat discovers emanations of injustice, dishonor, disorder, and sin from any creature with in its area of effect, a corridor 10 feet wide and 120 yards long. The duration of this spell effect is 1 turn + 5 rounds/level. Character alignment (or, more precisely, deviation from the ethos of law and good) is revealed only indirectly, if at all. The primary effect of this spell is to reveal whether a creature is accordance with the concept of maat—that is if they are at peace with the gods and living a happy life. A test of maat registers (indirectly) whether the person has performed activities offensive to Horus-Re such as providing offerings to Set or Sebek, acting disrespectfully to priests, treating slaves poorly, etc. If multiple individuals are within the area of effect, a priest must be of 5th level or greater to differentiate the status of each individual; otherwise the group is perceived as an average of sorts. The degree of discord in an individual and its general nature can be sensed by a priest of 9th level or higher. The priest must concentrate—stop, have quiet, and intently seek to detect the aura of maat—for at least one round to receive a reading. This aspect of the spell only functions with in the geographic sphere of influence of the Mulhorandi pantheon.\n\nIn its alternative form, a test of maat spell allows the priest to determine whether or not a morally ambiguous contemplated action falls within the strictures of maat. In this form, when a test of maat is cast, the priest imagines a possible course of action for himself or herself (and possibly some companions). The spellcaster immediately receive s a positive or negative feeling as to whether or not the contemplated action would violate the limits of maat, and the spell effect ends immediately there after. There is a base 100% chance of receiving an answer to this form of test of maat. However, Horus-Re encourages his followers' ability to think for themselves and is less responsive to requests to provide advice that occur less than a tenday apart. For every day less than 10 that has yet to pass between casting s of this spell, the base chance of not receiving a response increases by 10%. For example, if this form of a test of maat was last used three days ago prior to the current spellcasting, there is a 70% chance of not receiving a response.\n\nThe material component for this spell is the priest's holy symbol held over his left eye with his right hand.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Mulhorandi god Horus-Re of the Forgotten Realms setting."

If the saving throw is successful, the victim receives a curse of dire proportion that only a remove curse spell cast by a deity or a reverse bane or a wish cast by a mortal can remove. If the victim fails the saving throw, she or he suffers a -5 penalty to all attack and damage rolls while opponents receive a +5 bonus to their attack rolls against the victim. In addition, the victim automatically fails all saving throws and all attacks against him or her cause maximum damage.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, reverse bane, removes the effect of any curse-type spell (including bestow curse, major curse, bane, and other similar spells) except for instantaneous curse effects. (For example, it does not teleport a party back to the dungeon after they have opened a cursed scroll that teleported them out.)\n\nNotes: Granted by the Mulhorandi god Horus-Re of the Forgotten Realms setting."

Caste r may move at half their normal movement rate and maintain concentration (though they may not cake other action s); the swirling scythes move with the caster.\n\nAlthough this spell was created to reap the fields of Mulhorand, it is an extremely deadly combat spell as well. Any creature caught within the area of effect suffers 2 points of damage per round per swirling scythe.

If a properly mummified corporeal body sanctified by this spell is ever disturbed or its tomb despoiled, Osiris send the spirit of a divine minion to animate the mummy and cooperate with the resting ba to drive the grave robbers from the tomb. Such a mummy is lawful neutral in alignment, lacks the scabrous touch (mummy rot) of an invoked member of the ancient dead, exists only so long as defilers walk in the tomb sanctified in the name of Osiris, is only turnable or commandable by the clergy of Osiri, and cannot be resurrected. In addition, it is not specially vulnerable to fire, taking no damage from torches, 2d6 (first round) and 1d6 (second round) from a direct hit from burning oil, and no additional damage from magical fire. Finally, it is immune to damage from either holy or unholy water except for unholy water created by the church of Set, from which it takes 2d4 points of damage from a direct hit.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Mulhorandi deity Osiris of the Forgotten Realms setting."

Any glyph of warding, symbol, magic mouth, wizard lock, spell from the priest sphere of wards, or similar magic (as adjudicated by the DM) can be canceled by this spell, and every such ward in the area of effect must be checked when the spell is cast to determine if it is dispelled. This spell does not work against wall spells (wall of fire, wall of iron, etc.) or protective sphere spells (prismatic sphere, antimagic shell, etc.). Rather, it attempts to negate spells cast upon an item or entrance to guard it. Unlike casters of dispel magic, casters of dispel ward do not have option to directly affect enchanted items and temporarily negate their effects.\n\nThe chance to dispel a ward depends on the difference in level between the magical effect and the caster. The base chance of dispelling is 11 or higher on 1d20. As with a dispel magic spell, if the caster is of higher level than the ward to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted from the base number needed. If the caster is of lower level, the difference is added to the base. A die roll of 20 always succeeds and a die roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the ward magic she or he is trying to dispel, only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Mulhorandi god Set of the Forgotten Realms setting."

The birds obscure vision, limiting it to 20 feet. Spellcasting within the flock is impossible.\n\nIf the spell caster is of 11th level or greater and so desires, he can cause the birds co attack any one being within the area of effect, heedless of their own safety. Creatures within the flock are subject to countless suicidal attacks by diving birds and suffer 1d2 points of damage plus 1 point of damage for every four levels of the spellcaster (round down) per round. (Note that monsters immune to weapons of a nonmagical nature suffer no damage from the birds, which are in all respects ordinary avians.) Invisibility provides no protection, and neither does protection from normal missiles, as the birds are not missile weapons. Any creature within the area of effect must also make a morale check every other round (beginning with the second round of the spell's effect) or flee until it is more than 240 yards from the birds.\n\nNothing drives the flock of birds from the area of effect or dissuades them from attacking (if the spellcaster is of sufficient level and so desires). However any area-of-effect spell that inflicts a minimum of 4 points of damage (assuming all saving throws would be successfully made by the birds), encompasses the entire flock, and is cast after the flock of birds is summoned ends the flock of birds spell effect immediately by killing all the birds. Other attacks that inflict insufficient damage or have a smaller area of effect kill many of the birds, but do not noticeably decrease the size of the flock. An all-compassing protective barrier, such as that created by a cube of force, protects anyone within its confines for as long as the barrier exists or until the spell expires.\n\nNote that while the weaker version of this spell is fairly harmless, if the priest causes the flock of birds to attack, many of the birds are likely to perish during the aerial assault. As a result, some nature priests (particularly druids) are unhappy with the use of this spell and may seek to make the caster atone in some manner for its use.\n\nThe material components for this spell are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of feathers.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Mulhorandi god Thoth of the Forgotten Realms setting."

For example, if a priest were aware of the treasure carried by his companions and himself, he could ignore their carried coins while honing in on a buried chest of gems. Likewise, if a chest of 1,000 copper coins and a chest of 100 gold coins were buried in separate locations in the same room, by means of this spell the priest could find first the copper pieces and then begin to home in on the location of the gold.\n\nWhen casting this spell, the priest must make repeated sniffing sounds as the verbal component.

This spell combines the best aspects of fighters and mages, for they can work in harmony to maximize both the effects of the spell and the damage of the missile.\n\nThe conduit spell effectively extends the range of the second spell, casting that spell out to its full range from the target point when the missile hits the target. Unless otherwise specified when the spell is cast, the effects of the spell radiate forward from the point the arrowhead strikes.\n\nMissiles affected by this spell must begin to be fired within one turn after the last is enchanted, and they will not hold the spells for longer than an hour. Since the missiles are not specially prepared to hold enchantments for longer, the spells tend to bleed off with the passage of time.\n\nThe spells cast on the missiles must be separate ones that the caster has memorized that day. For example, if a sorceress has memorized conduit and a single fireball, she can place a fireball only on one of her arrows, not on all five.\n\nThe loaded spells are triggered when the head of the missile strikes something, whether that be the target, the ground, a tree, a rock, or whatever. This is good for radius attacks, such as a fireball, although it does no good for spells such as burning hands or shocking grasp.\n\nTargets are allowed normal saves against these spells, as if the wizard were right there casting the spell. However, if the missile carries the enspelled arrow beyond the spell's normal range, the wizard has no more control over the spell.\n\nFor example, web and dimension door spells require the caster to manipulate the spell, and casters cannot do so unless the range of their spell can reach back to them. Unless such wizards want to make the necessary calculations before casting the spell into the missile, these spells usually won't work. If a caster wishes to do so, fine, but this is assuming a lot of faith in the ability of whoever fires the bow, for the archer must make a successful to-hit roll against AC 6 (including modifiers for range) to hit the area.\n\nThe casting time does not include the casting time of the loaded spells. The material component is a copper wire twisted into the shape of an arrow.\n\nNotes: Restricted to elves, who guard is jealously; uncommon. Found mostly in the hands of fighter/mages."

If the cyclone exceeds the spell’s range, it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds—possibly endangering the caster or his allies—and then dissipates.\n\nAny creature of size L (large) or smaller that comes in contact with the whirlwind must make a saving throw vs. breath weapon or suffer 2d8 damage. Size M (man-sized) or smaller creatures who fail their first saving throw must attempt a second one, or be picked up bodily by the whirlwind and held suspended in its powerful winds, suffering 1d8 points of damage each round with no save allowed. The caster may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures whenever he wishes, depositing the hapless souls wherever the whirlwind happens to be when they are released.\n\nIn truly desperate circumstances, priests of elemental air have been known to deliberately overrun their companions in order to carry them out of the path of some certain doom. Few care to repeat the experience.\n\nMaintaining the whirlwind requires the caster’s full attention, and he cannot cast other spells or make any attacks while directing the spell's course.

Instead, the spell becomes uncontrolled as described above and dissipates after 1d3 rounds.\n\nThe material component for this spell is a handful of dust collected from a zephyr or snow from a williwaw.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for druids (PO:SM)."

        "Introduction": "This spell can be cast in one of two forms. In the most commonly used form, this magic freezes another spell that has earlier been cast into a focal stone, delaying its execution indefinitely. The frozen dweomer may not take effect for years, until released by a dweomerflow, wondrous web, or holy vesting spell; by the shattering of the focal stone; or by certain other spells that can extract magics from within such a magical prison. (Dispel magic is not one of these) The abeyance is broken by any such contact, freeing the spell to take instant effect, but if the contact is with a dweomerflow, wondrous web, or holy vesting spell, the abeyance fades but the stored magic is not released, being conveyed instead to another magical receptacle.\n\nThe second way that abeyance can be used affects only magical items (not artifacts). If the caster of the abeyance manages to directly touch a magical item with his or her bare flesh as this spell is cast, the next time the magical item is activated, its effect is delayed from taking effect for 1 round, and the abeyance dissipates thereafter.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell from the Forgotten Realms setting."

Personal equipment can be targeted, but the priest must, make a successful attack roll with a -4 penalty. If hit, the article of equipment ignites; burning clothing inflicts 1d6 points of damage for 1d6 rounds or until discarded. Burning shields become useless.

The somatic component involves the priest physically touching foreheads for one full round with each recipient. One ally per level of the spellcaster, up to a maximum of ten individuals, can be linked by means of this spell.\n\nOnce cast, the mental links forged by means of this spell last until the alert is broadcast or for at most eight hours. An alert has a maximum range of 90 feet around the priest. Anyone beyond that range won't hear the alert, although the spell effect (and the mental link) ends nonetheless.\n\nLikewise, anyone maintaining a psionic defense shield, wearing a ring of mind shielding, or employing similar magics won't receive the mental warning. However, if a recipient is asleep and that condition is not maintained by chemical or magical means (although it may have been induced by such), he or she immediately awakens and is aware that an alert has been issued.\n\nIt is possible to issue a mental missive and then perform another action aside from spell casting in the same round. The alert broadcast effectively imposes an initiative penalty of 1 on any other course of action attempted in the same round.\n\nNotes: Granted by the dwarven god Gorm Gulthyn.

Only the warrior benefits from his sacred bundle.\n\nTo create a sacred bundle, a warrior goes into a trance (usually with the help of the tribal medicine man). He contacts his guardian spirit, whom he asks for guidance. After carefully considering the warrior's personality and nature, the spirit selects 4-9 items (1d6+3) that the warrior must collect. Usually, several items will be difficult or dangerous to procure, such as a bear's claw, a giant snake's rattle, or a feather from the nest of an eagle.\n\nAfter collecting these items, the warrior takes them to the tribe's medicine man to ask for his help in mystically binding the materials. The medicine man then asks the warrior to gather one last rare item. This nearly always is an item the medicine man needs for his shamanistic duties; when the warrior returns, the medicine man takes part of the item for his own use.\n\nWhen all the items are assembled, the medicine man performs a ceremony binding them into the sacred bundle, which the warrior wears at all times. If the bundle is ever removed from the warrior's body, all of its benefits permanently vanish."

This blessing is a +1 modifier to the individual's saving throws, lasting for one day per level of the caster.\n\nAlternatively, the caster can ask the spirit to guard his home. In this case, the spirit acts as an infallible alarm against all nonmagical intrusions for one month. The spirit won't protect the home, it simply alerts the caster to an intrusion (no matter where the caster happens to be at the moment).\n\nThe material components of this spell are a dozen grains of any cereal or grain and a thimble filled with wine.\n\nNotes: Restricted to individuals from an oriental culture.

Typical acts include the desecration of a major temple or burial place, the massacre of a congregation, the theft of an important relic or artifact, and the like. In all cases, the principle of retribution is central to successful casting of the spell. The DM adjudicates the spell; misuse or overuse may result in its failure, or even visit its effect upon the caster. The ancient curse must be spoken in the presence of the malefactor and its conditions clearly announced. Thereafter, it is in effect.\n\nThe caster decides what form the curse takes, subject to the approval of the DM. The effects are long-term, developing over months and years and extending for centuries. These affect not only the original recipient, but descendants as well. Typical ancient curses include poverty, ill luck, a haunting, the onset of a degenerative disease, the periodic devastation of a household or property, and so on.\n\nThe spell is not necessarily permanent. It can be countered by an atonement spell or divine intervention in conjunction with a quest involving deeds of a magnitude equal to those for which the ancient curse was invoked. A curse brought on by greed that destroyed a village could be lifted by devoting one's life to poverty and charily.\n\nThe material component for this spell is a tiny silver gong and the priest's holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Common for priests from an oriental setting; otherwise, uncommon.",

Only animals that can be influenced by an animal friendship spell (animals with an Intelligence rating of 1-4) react in this way. When this spell is cast, a single creature determined by the priest during casting must make a successful saving throw vs. spell or be affected. If the saving throw is failed, all animals within 50 feet become hostile to the affected creature. Thus, normally aggressive and temperamental animals instantly attack, while normally passive animals react to moderately dangerous situations as if trapped in a corner or protecting young. (DMs should adjust a given animal's morale by 5 points to determine whether or not it feels threatened enough to attack.)\n\nThis spell does not function at its full potential if cast upon rangers or other beings who possess a natural ability that allows them to alter an animal's disposition. This spell simply prevents such beings from changing an animal's emotional state, but the animal does not become more hostile toward the creature. The spell and the natural ability effectively cancel out one another for the duration of the spell.\n\nSimilarly, spells that allow a caster to influence animals (e.g., animal friendship, charm person or mammal, etc.) fail when cast by an individual affected by this spell.\n\nAnimal animosity lasts for its full duration, unless removed with a remove curse, dispel magic, or a more potent spell.\n\nThe use of this spell is the province of Rillifane Rallathil, and those who have been subject to it often refer to it as Rillifane's Curse.\n\nNotes: Granted to priests of Rillifane Rallathil."

The creature is allowed a saving throw vs. spell. The DM determines the type of creature summoned, depending on terrain and/level of the caster. The creature's Hit Dice must be equal to or less than half the level of the caster. This beast is friendly toward the shukenja. It remains with the caster so long as he travels through the wilderness, but won't go more than 20 miles from its home. Upon entering any large encampment, village, or other settlement, the beast parts company with the shukenja. In addition, mistreating the beast causes it to leave or even turn on the shukenja.\n\nThe spell does not provide telepathic or perfect communication with the beast; however, it does understand the general meaning of spoken commands and gestures. The animal is still a wild beast and can be dangerous, especially misinterpreting common situations as threatening. If well treated, the animal defends and serves the shukenja to the best of its ability and nature. Thus, a monkey would prefer harassment and tricks to outright combat, while a tiger would fearlessly spring into the midst of the shukenja's foes. Common animals summoned include monkeys, hawks, badgers, boars, bears, tigers, and serpents.\n\nThe spell requires a piece of candy, sugar, or other tasty morsel for the creature summoned.\n\nNotes: Common for priests from an oriental setting; otherwise, very rare (animal friendship is the norm in Western cultures)."

It attacks as if wielded by the priest, but only once per round, and it cannot parry attacks against the priest. The weapon is effectively Armor Class 0. If more than 4 points of damage, plus 1 point of damage per level of the priest, are inflicted upon it in one round, the animated weapon drops to the ground, undamaged, and the spell immediately ends.\n\nWhile this spell is in effect, it is possible for the priest to cast other spells or perform any other action except attack with a melee weapon. The latter interferes with the animated weapon's ability to fight, ending the spell immediately.\n\nThe material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Granted by the dwarven god, Moradin.

For example, if a party is considering the destruction of a weird seal that closes a portal, an augury spell can be used to find if weal or woe will be the immediate result. If the spell is successful, the DM yields some indication of the probable outcome: “weal,” “woe,” or possibly a cryptic puzzle or rhyme. The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70%, plus 1%for each level of the priest casting the spell, e.g., 71% at 1st level, 72% at 2nd, etc. The DM determines any adjustments for the particular conditions of each augury.\n\nFor example, if the question is “Will we do well if we venture to the third/level?” and a terrible troll guarding 10,000 sp and a shield +1 lurks near the entrance to the level (which the DM estimates the party could beat after a hard fight) the augury might be: “Great risk brings great reward.” If the troll is too strong for the party, the augury might be: “Woe and destruction await!” Likewise, a party casting several auguries about the same action in quick succession might receive identical answers, regardless of the dice rolls.\n\nThe material component for an augury spell is a set of gem-inlaid sticks, dragon bones, or similar tokens of at least 1,000 gp value (which are not expended in casting).\n\nNotes: Common for clerics (PHB)."

        "Introduction": "This spell is used to activate a touched magical item bearing multiple enchantments or exhibiting multiple functions. It is an alternative to the better-known enchant an item spell, but accomplishes less. To create a magical item with an awakening spell, several other spells must be used first, including eternal flame and usually wondrous web or holy vesting and various dweomerflow castings. Awakening can be used on a magical item that has been created with an enchant an item spell if additional powers are added to the item after its initial creation and enough use of the item has occurred to call upon all of the original powers at least once.\n\nWhen the spell is cast, the item must make a saving throw to determine if the awakening has been successful. The item's base saving throw is the same as the caster's saving throw vs. spell, modified as follows: a -1 penalty per being other than the spellcaster who cast spells on the item during preparation or contributed magics that were put into the item before the awakening attempt (unless those beings are clergy members of the same faith as the caster of the awakening), a +1 bonus per meld and crown meld spell existing on the item, and a +1 bonus if both an eternal flame and a Veladar's vambrace, holy might, or Nulathoe's ninemen spell were cast on the item before the awakening attempt, and a +1 bonus if the awakening is cast on or before an altar of the deity of the caster's faith. These bonuses are cumulative, but a roll of 1 is always a failure.\n\nThe failure of an awakening attempt means either the item crumbles to worthless dust or explodes violently. Roll 1d6; a result of 1 or 2 means an explosion occurs similar to a fireball centered on the item that deals 1d6 points of damage per level of the awakening caster and in addition destroys the item utterly. A roll of 4-6 means that the item collapses into dust. A wind will rise from nowhere to carry this dust away, and even if some dust is somehow retained, it is magically inert and worthless.\n\nSuccess of the awakening attempt means the item is awakened instantly into operation. It functions perfectly, though if the creator has been careless or inattentive in his or her preparations, the item's performance may involve some surprises. A successful awakening may be heralded by a flash of light from the item, but this effect is never a harmful discharge of wild magic or item powers.\n\nThe material components for this spell are a single priest spell scroll bearing at least as many spells as the item has functions, a gem of any sort of not less than 2,500 gp value each for each item function, and a living plant that has been altered by magic. Some sages believe an awakening is more likely to succeed (an additional +1 bonus to the item saving throw at the DM's discretion) if a random dweomer-bearing component is also used.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell, recorded by Volo."

        "Introduction": "This spell creates an invisible magical aura around a willing (or unaware) creature. When either one of two specific spells or magical item effects chosen during casting impinges on any part of this aura, the mantle instantly absorbs the effects and presents the mantle-wearer with a threefold choice: use the spell energy for healing (either self-healing or healing a touched being), convert it to a single predetermined specific spell and hurl it back at the source, or convert it to the same predetermined specific spell and cast it at another target. If the mantle-wearer is not the caster, the caster can elect, when bestowing the spell, to force the magic to always make one of those choices or to leave each decision up to the mantle-wearer. (Nevertheless, the “free choice” cannot be restricted to two of the three options, nor can any of the “predetermined” spells be left unselected.)\n\nHealing: If an incoming magic is used for healing, only lost hit points are restored. This healing can be used upon one creature only - it cannot be split.\n\nA given being can be protected by only one alteration mantle at a time, and the mantle won't survive any contact with a dispel magic effect. Despite the fact that it can guard against two different spell attacks, they can only be transformed into a single magic. Over the years, Azuth has ignored the repeated supplications of his most powerful and devoted followers to provide two “end result” magics as well as two magics protected against.\n\nReturn Casting: The spell sent forth behaves as if cast by the original source in terms of level, alignment, and abilities. Targeting, however, depends on the vision and abilities of the mantle-wearer. (For instance, if an incoming polymorph other attack is converted to magic missile and hurled at a third party, the mantle-wearer, not the\n\noriginal attacker, must be able to see the chosen target for the magic missile.)\n\nBoth the specific spells to be defended against and the spell they are to be converted to must be chosen by the caster of the alteration mantle during its casting and cannot be altered thereafter. The magic defended against must be one the mantle caster has cast, felt the effects of, or observed the effects of, and he must know its specific name. The magic sent forth must be a spell he has personally cast. The magic sent forth cannot exceed the magic defended against in spell level (for instance, polymorph other cannot be converted to flame strike). Azuth's alteration mantle defends against multiple attacks of the same sort of spell, and is not exhausted by one incoming spell. This spell is a variant of the greater mantle of Mystra spell used by priests of the goddess of magic.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Azuth, god of wizards, of the Forgotten Realms setting. This spell is found only in a few exceptionally rare tomes."

Each burst consists of five such missiles. All of the missiles in a burst are directed at the same target, which they strike unerringly (doing no damage to nonliving materials, but inflicting 1d4+1 points of damage each to creatures). Each burst must be fired at a different target (in other words, five missiles strike at one target, five at another, and five at a third - even if this means wasting 10 of the missiles). Missiles fired into empty air fade away at the limits of spell range.\n\nCertain veteran priests speak of the magical items of foes discharging involuntarily when struck by a burst from a firing frenzy, but this seems to be a rare and unpredictable occurrence.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Azuth, god of wizards, of the Forgotten Realms setting. This spell is found only in a few exceptionally rare tomes."

If this is not possible, the spell can also be removed by remove curse or wish spell.\n\nIf not cast in order to cancel bad medicine, the spell's reverse, good medicine, is not nearly as powerful as its vengeful form.

To use bat sense, the being must close its eyes, but this causes no penalties in either movement or combat. No concentration is required to maintain the sense.\n\nWhile using bat sense, the individual cannot be surprised and can “see” any invisible, displaced, or camouflaged item within 60 feet. Psionic invisibility, however, cannot be detected. Mirror images are not detected at all; nor can the individual detect illusions, projected images, clouds, gases, or insubstantial spirits such as ghosts. If such objects are capable of harming the individual, the being won't know what is attacking until opening its eyes, temporarily nullifying the spell's effects.\n\nThus, insubstantial or gaseous creatures could attack with a +4 bonus to hit.\n\nThis spell works by picking up sound waves; a silence, /5 radius spell will nullify the effect. Loud noises do not harm or hamper the recipient.\n\nThe material component of the spell is a bit of fur from a bat's ear, which must be eaten by the being that wants to use the sense.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell.

Its further reaction depends on the animal's nature. Aggressive animals, including predators and most trained guard animals, attack. Nonaggressive beasts shun the individual, fleeing or attacking if approached. Owners can restrain their domesticated animals, but the beasts show obvious distress and may become very hostile if the character tries to touch them.\n\nIf the subject was riding when the spell took effect, the mount tries to throw off the character. The person must make a riding proficiency check each round to stay astride and to avoid a fall if thrown off.\n\nAn animal extremely loyal to the subject, such as a pet dog, a creature influenced by an animal friendship spell, a wizard's familiar, or a paladin's war horse does not become utterly hostile to its owner. Instead, it notices something “wrong” about the character and acts unusually nervous.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for druids and similar nature priests."

Their reactions are improved for every day dealings, not for very unusual events.\n\nNotes: Common for priests from an oriental setting; otherwise, very rare."

When cast the spell summons a lock of Berronar's hair, which turns into gold within 24 hours after its arrival. The golden lock is worth 2,000-8,000 gp. It does not radiate magic, nor can it be dispelled or negated. Despite the usefulness of this spell, it has two important restrictions:\n\nFirst, the spell must be cast on behalf of a suffering dwarven enclave, and the acquired gold must be used to help the enclave through its difficult times. If the gold is used for any other purpose, especially an evil or selfish purpose (for example, personal gain) the gold is forfeit and vanishes immediately.\n\nSecond, the caster must be Berronar's high priest in the enclave and of lawful good alignment.\n\nIf these conditions are not met, Berronar simply refuses to grant the spell Obviously, Berronar's adventuring priests are unlikely to receive this spell while away from their enclave. This spell can be cast only by priests of Berronar Truesilver.\n\nThe material component for this spell is the caster's holy symbol. The casting time accounts for other factors in the spell's casting such as prayer, meditation, and the like.\n\nNotes: Granted by the dwarven god Berronar Truesilver."

Although they retain the hands and eyes of men and continue to wield weapons in this state, they lose all fear of death and enter a killing rage They must attack any enemy they see and cannot be given orders. Thus, any hope of coordinating an attack is completely lost. Due to their blind rage, they suffer a -4 modifier on ability checks involving Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, but receive a +2 bonus to all saving throws vs. spell.\n\nWhile the spell lasts, the warriors are immune to the following priest spells: charm person or mammal, all spells in the Charm sphere, protection from evil, protection from evil, 10' radius, and dispel evil. They are also immune to the following wizard spells: protection from evil, protection front evil, W radius, repulsion, all spells in enchantment/charm school, and all spells in the illusion/phantasm school.\n\nWarriors under the influence of a berserk spell, receive a +4 adjustment to their Strength score, with the accompanying modifiers to their attack and damage rolls, and their AC is modified by a +2 (so that, for example, AC 4 becomes AC 2). A berserk spell frees the warriors from having to make a morale check, and renders them immune to fire damage.\n\nWarriors who die while under the influence of a berserk spell are assured of a place in Valhalla. This spell can only be cast on fighters, and only if they are willing recipients.\n\nNotes: Restricted to priests from a Norse culture; rare."

        "Introduction": "By touching a creature, the caster bestows a major curse upon it. The caster can choose any effect from the list of major curse effects (see list). The creature is allowed a saving throw vs. spell; success negates the curse. Neither dispel magic nor remove curse can rid a creature of this effect. Only a wish or remove major curse is an effective remedy. The spell requires some personal possession of the creature (this is not consumed in the casting).\n\nThe reverse of the spell, remove major curse, counters any of the major curse effects.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell, used by evil priests. (Updated from Dragon Magazine.)",
        "Major Curse Effects": "* Aging\n * Age Regression\n * Agonizing Pain\n * Alter Gender\n * Alter Race\n * Alter Sub-Race\n * Amnesia\n * Aura, Antipathy\n * Aura, Attraction\n * Blindness\n * Breathing Air\n * Breathing Water\n * Conditional Death\n * Conditional Petrifaction\n * Confusion\n * Deafness\n * Deafening Voice\n * Disfigurement\n * Gelatinous Form\n * Growth\n * Halitosis, Deadly\n * Insanity\n * Lycanthropy\n * Multiple Personalities\n * Muteness\n * Polymorph\n * Shrinking\n * Touch, chilling\n * Touch, flora wilting\n * Touch, petrifaction\n * Touch, poison\n * Touch, scorching\n * Touch, shocking\n * Touch, withering\n * Undeath\n * Vulnerability\n * Weakness\n * Withering",
        "Effect Explanations": "Aging: This curse ages the subject 10–60 years, or the demihuman equivalent. Only the disadvantages of aging are acquired in this process.\n\nAge Regression: This curse makes the subject age rapidly backward, to the age of 16 minus 2d8 for a human, or the demihuman equivalent. The regression might be nearly instantaneous, or might take place over a number of days or weeks.\n\nAgonizing Pain: The PC is wracked by continual pain. This reduces Dexterity reaction time, attack rolls, and any saving throws involving Dexterity all by 6 points. Hit points are reduced by 25% so long as the curse is in effect. Furthermore, any spellcasting has a 50% chance of failure.\n\nAlter Gender: The permanent change of one's sex can be most disconcerting.\n\nAlter Race: Changes the subject's race; an elf can become a dwarf; a human a halfling etc.\n\nAlter Sub-Race: This change involves an alteration within the same genus, as in a change from grey elf to high elf or wood elf to drow. Note the sub races of humanity fall into this category, as well.\n\nAmnesia: This is a total loss of memory (but not survival and self-preservation skills associated with being an adult).\n\nAura, Antipathy: The aura causes creatures around the subject to have hostile feelings towards him. Charisma is virtually 10 points lower than normal even among close friends and family. All reaction checks register as hostile.\n\nAura, Attraction: Aside from attracting the unwanted affection of everyone the subject comes in contact with, the cursed individual might be caught in the middle of an armed confrontation between two such creatures wanting his or her attentions. Note that it is not healthy for some creatures to be too friendly toward the accursed (needle men etc.)\n\nBlindness: Much like the spell of the same name, this cannot be dispelled by any means other than a wish or a remove major curse spell.\n\nBreathing, Air: Imagine its effect on a sea dweller especially if the recently cursed person or creature is underwater at the time the spell is cast.\n\nBreathing, Water: This works the same as the air breathing curse but affects those dwelling on land and breathing air.\n\nConditional Death: If the cursed person does a certain act, he dies. The caster decides the trigger, which must be both voluntary and unnecessary for survival. For example, sneezing is involuntary, breathing and eating are necessary, but eating meat is not. Depending on the nature of the casting the subject may or may not know the nature of the problem.\n\nConditional Petrifaction: If the cursed person does a certain act he turns to stone. The caster decides the trigger. For example, the PC might turn to stone if he is exposed to direct sunlight. Depending on the nature of the casting of the curse the accursed may or may not know the nature of his problem. A stone to flesh spell dispels the effect of this curse.\n\nConfusion: Under extreme stress (frequently the case while adventuring), the accursed acts as if under the effects of a confusion spell.\n\nDeafness: Aside from the communication problems, a deafened spellcaster has a 25% chance of spell failure if casting a spell with a verbal component. The accursed is more easily surprised (95%) unless looking exactly in the right direction.\n\nDeafening Voice: Every word that leaves the subject's mouth is deafeningly loud. A whisper sounds like 10 men shouting, a yell like a flight of dragons roaring.\n\nDisfigurement: This is a serious deformation of the cursed person's body. This might affect movement, fighting ability, or the reaction of others.\n\nGelatinous Form: The accursed becomes a virtual blob. Spellcasting and weapon use are all but impossible.\n\nGrowth: Being giant-sized isn't a problem? It is up to the DM whether the subject's clothing and gear grow with him.\n\nHalitosis, Deadly: This atrocious case of bad breath has an effect equal to that of a cloudkill spell on any creature within 10 feet of the subject's mouth and standing in front of the subject.\n\nInsanity: Anyone attempting to remove this curse by any other means is also affected unless a successful saving throw vs. spell is made. If successful, a second saving throw is required against confusion, as the spell of the same name.\n\nLycanthropy: This is the familiar age-old curse. The caster chooses what type of were-creature the accursed becomes.\n\nMultiple Personalities: The cursed person might mistakenly assume the curse is temporary amnesia. Each of the resulting 3-12 personalities has no knowledge of the others' existence nor any recollection of memories gained by them.\n\nMuteness: Aside from the communication problems, this eliminates the ability to cast spells that have a verbal component.\n\nPolymorph: Only a wish or a remove major curse spell can return the subject to normal; a polymorph other spell or similar effect fails.\n\nShrinking: This curse turns a man-sized person into a pixie-sized person, and so on.\n\nTouch: Several different major curses involve the effect of the subject touching another. While some effects may be beneficial in combat, they virtually eliminate social interaction. If this type of curse is used to achieve a temporary combat advantage (and removed afterward), the DM can inflict secondary effects, such as having the subject nauseated and unable to perform any actions for 1d4+1 turns after the curse is removed. In any case, gloves or gauntlets do not prevent the touch curse's effects from being transmitted. DMs may even extend the “touch” to any physical contact not just hands.\n\nTouch, Chilling: The accursed person's touch causes 1d10 points of freezing damage. This cannot harm undead or creatures immune to cold. While this can be used as a weapon, it causes problems in normal social interaction.\n\nTouch, Floral Wilting: This is sure to attract the hostile attention of nature lovers, druids, and forest dwellers, and end any career plans in gardening or horticulture.\n\nTouch, Petrifaction: The accursed can turn flesh to stone by a simple touch. As with other touch curses the target of the spell has no control over whom is petrified by his touch. While this may seem a benefit in combat, it soon proves to be a curse.\n\nTouch, Poison: The accused's touch is instant death. The creatures touched get a saving throw vs. death magic but at a penalty of -4. Undead are not affected.\n\nTouch, Scorching: The subject's touch causes 1d10 points of fire-based damage and ignites any exposed combustibles. The subject's normal clothing and equipment are not immune to the effects of the flames that envelope his hands.\n\nTouch, Shocking: The subject's grasp delivers a jolt of electricity to the person or creature touched. This causes 1d10 points of electrical damage. Combustibles on or in close proximity to the subject are ignited.\n\nTouch, Withering: The accused's touch becomes exactly like that of a staff of withering.\n\nUndeath: This is believed to be how skeleton warriors originated. The subject instantly becomes an undead creature, but retains all intelligence and former abilities. The accursed is under the caster's control unless the caster does not so specify, or the caster dies. A resurrection spell reverses the curse. The undead subject may be unable to function in daylight or his body may begin to decay or desiccate.\n\nVulnerability: The subject will weaken and die if exposed to some substance for too long a time. The DM decides how the details are applied.\n\nWeakness: The subject is unable to do much for himself. Constant attention by another is necessary for daily survival.\n\nWithering: Regardless of how much is eaten or if magical items are employed (such as a ring of sustenance), the subject continues to lose weight until he perishes from starvation."

        "Effect Explanations": "Adherence: The subject becomes very sticky. Items touched adhere to the fingers, preventing the use of material components. Alcohol topically applied can negate this effect for several rounds. The subject can pull away from solidly anchored objects with successful Strength check. The caster can affect either the victim's whole body or just part of it.\n\nAnimal Features: This curse causes the subject's features (ears, nose, etc.) to become animal-like. Which animal's features are gained is entirely up to the caster.\n\nAppendage Growth: One of the victim's appendages grows to a disproportionate size.\n\nAppendage Shrinkage: This curse effect is the opposite of appendage growth.\n\nArthritis: The victim suffers from painful arthritis. The Dexterity is reduced by 2 and somatic gestures are 25% likely to fail.\n\nBabbling: The cursed individual constantly talks and chatters unable to remain silent for more than a moment This causes a 25% chance of spell failure.\n\nBaldness: In addition to affecting the subject, this can also be cast to cause those around the cursed one for any great length of time to suffer baldness as well.\n\nBarkskin: The subject's skin takes on the texture and appearance of tree bark, increasing base Armor Class to 6. Fire saving throws are at a -2 penalty and fire-based damage is increased +2 per die of damage.\n\nBelching: Uncontrollable belching causes a 25% chance of spell failure while casting, and likewise reduces any chance to Move Silently or be quiet.\n\nBody Odor: The subject develops a repugnant body odor, lowering Charisma by 2 points.\n\nBrooding: The victim is continually downcast, lowering Charisma by 2 points.\n\nCasting Requirements: This establishes a short action (dancing a jig, knocking on wood, etc.) that a spellcaster must perform before or during spell casting for the spell to be effective. (The DM might require the player to actually perform the action).\n\nChange Skin Color: The subject's skin changes to any hue of the caster's choice.\n\nChills: The subject suffers chills as with a fever, lowering reaction time and dropping overall Dexterity by 2 points.\n\nContinual Smiling: While not seeming much of a curse, this can result in many a skirmish. Many will be offended by the subject's constant grin.\n\nDancing: The subject breaks into a dance, jig, or caper at the most inopportune moments. Armor Class and saving throws have a -2 penalty, while spellcasting has a 20% chance of spell failure.\n\nDouble Vision: The subject makes attack rolls at a -2 penalty; effective Dexterity is lowered by 2 points.\n\nElasticity: The subject can stretch his body beyond its normal shape. Unfortunately, the body takes 1d4 hours to return to its normal shape, during which time Dexterity is reduced by 4 points.\n\nFilthiness: The subject remains dirty no matter how many baths are taken. This filthiness extends to the clothing as well. Charisma is reduced by 2 points.\n\nFloral Hair: The subject's hair becomes like weeds, grass, twigs, and flowers. While possibly improving the reaction of woodland creatures, it otherwise lowers Charisma by 2 points.\n\nForgetfulness: Lapses of memory triggered by certain events or contact with particular objects or creatures incur a 25% chance of spell failure. The effects on non-spellcasters is determined by the DM.\n\nGenerosity: The subject feels an irresistible need to give away everything of value that he owns.\n\nGreed: The subject covets anything of value that anyone else owns. Often this leads to theft.\n\nHair Growth: The subject is beset by rapid uncontrollable hair growth. The caster can choose to make this over the entire body or just the head.\n\nHalitosis: The subject develops breath so foul that all within 10 feet have a -2 penalty to attacks and a 20% chance of spell failure.\n\nHiccupping: This increases chances of spell failure by 23%. It is otherwise similar to belching.\n\nInsatiable Appetite: The subject can't satisfy feelings of overwhelming hunger and suffers a -2 penalty to all actions when uneaten food is present.\n\nInsatiable Thirst: This curse has the same effect as insatiable hunger except that it causes a thirst that cannot be quenched.\n\nInsomnia: The subject is always tired, and has a 25% chance of spell failure during casting.\n\nItching: The caster chooses whether this is non-stop itching or triggered by an event or stress. The subject's Dexterity and attack rolls are reduced by 2, and any spellcasting is 25% likely to fail.\n\nKleptomania: The subject has an irresistible urge to pilfer from others (if not a thief, he won't be very good at it).\n\nLethargy: The subject suffers extreme drowsiness either all the time or when under stress. Dexterity and attack rolls are reduced by 2, and any spellcasting is 25% likely to fail.\n\nMetal Allergy: Every time the subject touches metal, his hand breaks out in hives and blisters. This gives a -2 (or -10%) penalty to any activity requiring the use of the hands.\n\nMyopia (extreme near-sightedness): The subject has a -2 penalty to missile attacks and uses the grenade-like missile table to determine the center of area attacks.\n\nNarcissism: The subject becomes extremely vain, and quick to point out his own looks to everyone, while pointing out their flaws. Those spending any time around the subject react as if his Charisma was 2 points lower than normal.\n\nNausea: This arises when conditions set by the caster are met (for example, entering a small room meeting a dwarf etc.). Attack rolls are at a -2 penalty and spellcasting failure is 25% likely.\n\nPathological Lying: No explanation is necessary to portray what an inability to tell the truth can cause.\n\nProfuse Sweating: While not causing any detrimental effects of a physical nature, this curse might have deleterious effects on Charisma. It might also make the hands slippery at inopportune times.\n\nSerpent Hair: The subject can be mistaken for a medusa by others who may be prone to attack first and examine the corpse later. The subject's hair changes into locks of living serpents. These snakes are indeed poisonous to all but the victim, making them hazardous to those who are close to him.\n\nSerpent Hand: One or both of the victim's hands becomes the maw of a living poisonous snake. The type of snake is decided by the caster of the curse. The snakes cannot harm the victim, but are not under his control, attacking any else who ventures too close.\n\nShaking: Body spasms reduce the subject's Dexterity and attack rolls by 2 points and cause a 25% chance for error in casting spells with a somatic portion.\n\nSlurred Speech: Aside from making the subject hard to understand, a spellcaster has a 25% chance of spell failure if the spell has a verbal component.\n\nSmoldering: The subject constantly emits smoke from his skin and hair. This can cause some visual impairment, reducing attack rolls by 2 points and causing errors in distance judgment for spell casting. Furthermore, anyone suffering from this curse has no chance of going undetected unless he is standing downwind in a gale.\n\nSneezing: Sneezing fits occur when a particular event happens or the subject is under stress, causing a 25% chance of spell failure during casting.\n\nSpike Growth: Once cursed, the subject sprouts spikes all over his body. While the spikes are no danger to the accursed, they can cause serious damage to clothing and to others (1d4 points of damage per spike).\n\nStumbling: This affects Dexterity with regard to movement. Any walking or running requires a successful Dexterity check at a -2 penalty to avoid tripping over one's own feet. This is in addition to a general penalty of -2 to the effective Dexterity score.\n\nTruth: This is the opposite of pathological lying.\n\nUncontrollable Laughter: Many people find being laughed at insulting. This can have serious repercussions when the accursed laughs at the wrong persons in the wrong places.\n\nUnintentional Insulting: The cursed individual has no control over his tongue when around others. It usually only takes a few curse-inspired insults to cause major problems.\n\nVulgarity: Insults can be forthcoming with this curse but unlike the unintentional insulting curse, profanity is uttered in some form with every breath.\n\nWart Growth: The cursed person becomes covered from head to toes with warts. This reduces Charisma by 4 points.\n\nWeariness: The accursed individual is always tired. This causes a -2 penalty to attack rolls. Furthermore, this curse reduces Constitution by 2 points. This makes wearing armor or equally heavy objects for long periods of time nearly impossible.\n\nWeight Gain: The subject immediately begins to gain weight at a rate of 5 pounds per day. The curse ultimately adds 100 pounds to the subject's original weight. Of course, clothing and armor no longer fit.\n\nWeight Loss: The exact opposite of weight gain. However, the subject's weight is not reduced below 1% of the original weight.\n\nWhistling: This curse appears at random times. When it does it has a 25% chance not only of interrupting the subject's spellcasting, but also of interrupting the spellcasting of those in the immediate vicinity. It also makes hiding difficult."

        "Introduction": "This spell is used to bind a guardian spirit to a new site or to a physical object. The spirit gets a saving throw vs. spell to resist. A successful save means the spirit remains free and can attack the shaman. If the spirit is currently guarding a particular place, the shaman can bind it into a bone (which must be at least as old as the spirit – tricky if the spirit has been there for several centuries). As long as the shaman carries that bone, the guardian spirit con be called once per week to defend the shaman for up to a turn. The guardian will not otherwise obey any commands. Only the casting shaman can use the bone in this way.\n\nThe spell can also be used to reset the spirit – taking it from the bone and placing it as a guard over a new site specified by the caster. The new location can be no more than one hundred yards across, and must be a fixed, static area with clear boundaries. Movable objects like tents and chariots cannot have guardian spirits set over them. In open areas, a boundary must be defined with a fence, ditches, or something similar. If the new site has no clear perimeter, or if the boundary is destroyed, the spirit guards only an area 15 feet across in the very center.\n\nWhen the spirit is removed from the bone to be set at a new site, the bone crumbles away.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for shamans."

If at any time, the blade and the caster are separated by more than 60 feet, the spell ends and the weapon falls to the ground.\n\nAny time after the spell is cast, the bladed weapon can be cast into the air by the priest and commanded to attack. The weapon flies toward the target creature by the most direct route. It attacks any creature that tries to block its way. If left to itself, it will fight its way to the intended target through all opposition; however, the caster can, at will, take direct control of its flight, its positioning, and its attack. Doing so requires full concentration on the weapon for the entire round, otherwise the blade attacks on its own.\n\nThe weapon attacks once per round, as if wielded by the caster. If bladedance is cast on a magical weapon that has powers activated by the wielder (such as the radiance effect of a sun-blade), the caster must concentrate on the blade in order to use them. The dancing weapon does not take normal melee damage, but any attack that might destroy the weapon under normal circumstances can affect it and. Of course, the bladedance is subject to dispelling. If the weapon is engaged in nonlethal combat, it defends as if it was the caster. While the blade is acting on its own, the caster can take any other actions: discharging missiles, spell-casting, melee, and so on.\n\nAt 5th level, the priest can cast bladedance on any size S bladed melee weapon. At 7th level, the priest can cast the spell on a size S or M bladed melee weapon. At 9th level, a size S, M, or L bladed melee weapon can be affected.\n\nThe material component is the priest's holy symbol, which is touched to the weapon.\n\nNotes: Granted by the drow goddess Eilistraee."

(The surfaces must be within 20 yards when the spell is first cast.) The caster must have touched both surfaces with his or her bare flesh at some time before the spell is cast.\n\nItems to be transported must fit totally on or within the enchanted surfaces. Each surface can send one item per round to the other, and a particular Blaenther's bowls spell can send an item only one way; it must be picked up and set down again on the destination surface to return to its origination surface. When dealing with a sequence of items to be transported, the first item to be placed on a surface is transported first. If many items are on a surface, the one that has been there longest is transported before the others; for items with identical seniority, randomly determine which moves first. Items that are too large are not sent, nor are those held by a living or dead being. Living or undead substances touching the linked surfaces are not sent. Either linked surface can be moved without breaking the magic, so long as the two never part more than 100 feet per caster level.\n\nThis spell was devised long ago by Blaenther Oldryn, a priest of Waukeen. Blaenther used this spell as most priests do today: to whisk coin offerings from a bowl to an inner area and to send scrolls, weapons, and needed items to clergy members stationed by the bowl as requested (by prewritten notes dropped into the bowl or by signal gongs).\n\nThe material components are a pinch of gold dust, a spiral of fine wire, and a carved ivory or bone arrow of any size with arrowheads at both ends.\n\nNotes: Granted by the goddess Waukeen of the Forgotten Realms setting."

The container must be at least the size of a man's hand and must have a material cost of at least 500 gp. The scion may be a willing participant in this spell, but the spell can be cast on an unwilling subject. A scion that resists is allowed a saving throw vs. death magic with a +1 bonus for every 10 points of bloodline strength.\n\nOnce the bloodline is transferred, the scion can access the bloodline by placing himself in contact with the container. This also grants access to any accumulated Regency Points (RP), and the character can collect and spend RP normally.\n\nIf the scion and the container are separated by more than 10 feet, the bloodline is rendered inert for as long as they remain apart. If the scion is a regent, he cannot perform domain actions, collect RP, or spend RP while separated from his bloodline. The character is treated in all ways as if unblooded. This can prevent a true wizard from casting spells.\n\nIf the container is broken or seriously damaged (a metal vessel might be crushed flat, for example) but remains within 10 feet of the regent, the bloodline immediately reverts to its owner and the spell is broken. If the container is broken or seriously damaged at a distance of more than 10 feet from the scion, the bloodline and regency are lost forever.\n\nWhen the spell's duration elapses, the magic of the blood bank spell transfers the bloodline back to the scion if he is within one mile of the container. If the scion is more than one mile from the vessel, the bloodline and regency are lost forever.\n\nNo known magic can transfer a bloodline from a container into another individual while the scion lives. Bloodtheft is impossible while a bloodline is banked; if the regent dies by any means (including tighmaevril) while the bloodline resides within the vessel, it is immediately transferred to a designated heir. Without an heir, the land chooses the recipient of the bloodline.\n\nThe material components are a lock of the scion's hair, a handful of dirt from his domain (if a regent) or homeland (if a non-regent), and a garnet worth 100 gp.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for priests from Cerilia, the Birthright setting; virtually unknown elsewhere."

Both are allowed a saving throw vs. spell, but willing participants can forego the saving throw if they wish. If either saving throw succeeds, the spell fails.\n\nBlood bond links the health of the two individuals. When one suffers damage, both split the points of damage (if the damage is an odd number, the one actually struck takes the extra point). If either of the two individuals dies, the spell ends. The shared effect applies only to hit points – it does not apply to actual burns, acid damage, etc. A character struck by a fireball, for example, would roll his saving throw to determine full or half damage, then divide the damage between the two bonded characters. The second character would not receive a saving throw, but also would not suffer burns and would not have to roll saving throws for items.\n\nVos war priests commonly cast this spell on one Vos warrior and one prisoner, effectively doubling the damage the warrior can take in battle, assuming the prisoner survives the trauma. The bonded individuals share damage regardless of distance between the two.\n\nNon-evil priests normally cast this spell only on two willing comrades. Paladins of Haelyn often use blood bond to fortify their own shield brothers in battle.\n\nThe material components are the priest's holy symbol and a length of red silk ribbon.\n\nNotes: Common for priests from Cerilia, the Birthright setting."

One effect of this cry is to establish a magical effect identical to a prayer spell in the area of effect of the bloodgloat. Also, creatures in the area of effect that are enemies of the priest suffer an additional -1 penalty to attack and damage rolls, saving throws, and morale unless they make a successful saving throw vs. spell. Finally, any creature hostile to the priest that fails its save by a margin of -6 or worse is subject to a magical effect identical to that of a symbol of hopelessness. Thus, if the creature requires a 13 to save and rolls 7 or less, it is affected by the hopelessness (such creatures turn back in dejection or surrender; the effect lasts for 3d4 turns).\n\nThe spell requires an immediately slain enemy as the spell focus.\n\nNotes: Granted by Iuz the Evil of the World of Greyhawk setting."

The effects produced are living, but if produced from a dead source (for example, making an oaken door sprout leaves and acorns). these growths eventually die from lack of sustenance. Living plants react normally to the new shoots and blossoms. A plant-based creature gains 1 hit point per Hit Die, up to its maximum limit, for a full week. Blossom can be very useful in aiding victims of starvation (one could produce immature wheat cars from straw).\n\nThe reverse of this spell, blight, causes any object of vegetable matter, to have its appendages\n\nshrivel up and drop off. A solid object (for example., an oaken beam) is not affected. Any fruit, blooms, buds, leaves, and so forth are instantly destroyed. A plantlike creature, such as a shambling mound, must make a successful saving throw vs. death magic or take 6d4 points damage. Blight is extraordinarily useful against a yellow musk creeper (all its blossoms fall off harmlessly).\n\nNotes: Very rare for druids and other nature priests. (Updated from Dragon Magazine.)"

They materialize through or out of any armor, gear, or clothing worn, but don't obscure the senses or affect Dexterity. Even if they grow from the face, vision is unimpaired; if they grow from the hands, spell-casting and the like is unimpeded; and if “sticking” into adjacent body parts, they do no damage and act as if they were mere illusions.) The blades never harm gear worn or carried by the caster.\n\nTo others, the spiny forest of blades augments the caster's Armor Class by 2 points, and inflicts harm as follows: If the caster charges, the blades impale for 1d4+2 points of damage. If the caster hugs, overbears, or drives a foe against a solid surface. such as a wall, damage is doubled (a successful attack roll, without bonuses, is required to manage such maneuvers).\n\nIf a caster with body blades is caught in a constricting situation (such as a closing door or compressing, moving wall), the blades halt the movement, preventing damage, though the caster will be wedged in tightly.\n\nThe material components are two shards of metal that each possess at least one sharp edge or point (bladed weapons can be used), and one shard of bone with at least on sharp edge or point (from any source).\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil goddess Loviatar of the Forgotten Realms setting.

        "Introduction": "Using this spell, a priest can prevent death from decapitation or dismemberment. The spell links the parts of the caster's body, so that separation from the main body will not impair them in any way. For instance, a priest's head could be cut off yet still talk, or even eat, as if it were still attached to the caster's body; if an arm is cut off. the caster still has muscular control and can even wield weapons. If the head is cut off, the body falls limp unless the caster rolls a successful Wisdom check.\n\nThe base duration of the spell is one turn per caster level, during which time the spell sits passive, waiting to take effect. Once the head or any limb is cut off, the spell continues for one round per caster level. During this time, if the limb or head is placed back on the trunk, it immediately reattaches.\n\nThis prevents harm only from decapitation or dismemberment; other damage applies normally. Thus, while the spell is proof against beheading or vorpal swords, the caster can be killed by an accurate sword thrust. Also, since the body sometimes falls limp when the caster loses his head, it is a good idea to have a friend nearby to reattach the head before the spell's duration ends.\n\nThe material components of the body link spell are a pearl worth at least 500 gp, which is destroyed during casting, and a small amount of tree sap, which must be consumed by the caster.\n\nNotes: Common for priests from an arabian setting; otherwise very rare."

        "Introduction": "A bonechain spell causes a chain of skeletons under the caster's control to suddenly spring from scattered bones. It requires special preparation in the form of material components. For each link in the chain, the priest must have one bone from a deceased human or humanoid creature. Any bone can be employed, although tradition prefers finger or rib bones. Each bone must come from a separate creature: the spell fails the instant a second bone from the same creature is activated. The maximum number of bones usable in the spellcasting is equal to the priest's experience level. Each bone can be placed up to 20 feet from any other bone employed in the spell. A distance of greater than 20 feet negates the continuation of the bonechain.\n\nWhen the spell is cast, at the point where each bone is placed, a skeleton springs up and will do the bidding of the priest casting the spell, automatically fighting the nearest enemy of the priest, if appropriate. Skeletons activate rapidly and sequentially from the bone nearest the caster outward, at the rate of 5 per round. Each activated skeleton has a minimum of 5 hit points, but is otherwise a normal animated skeleton. Concealed or covered bones might be used. Bones buried in earth, hidden in plasterwork or within wooden paneling, and so on, can spring forth as skeletons: bones buried below foot-thick marble slabs could not (the DM decides doubtful cases). Skeletons animated by a bonechain remain in existence until the dawn following the casting of the bonechain spell, unless destroyed earlier.\n\nThis spell was specifically developed to enable ambushes, with bones planted in the ground in a circle or column, and for protection, with ranks of bones hidden in alcoves, urns and the like along corridors and passages.\n\nThe material components for the spell are the bones employed and an unholy symbol of Iuz.\n\nNotes: Granted by Iuz the Evil of the World of Greyhawk setting."

        "Dragon Magazine Text (1e)": "* Created by: Christopher Krough\n\nThis spell creates a magical stone — diamond-hard but black — that burns as a glowing coal at the bearer's command. The material component of this spell consists of a burning piece of coal and a diamond of any size (the latter being consumed in the spell's casting). Even when cold, the stone has a dull, crimson glow, deep within it, and has a natural value equal to the original value of the diamond used, plus 20% (in addition to any magical value). The coalstone gives a dim radiance within a 5'-radius circle, and burns anyone (including the bearer) for 1 hp damage per round held if no protection against fire is used.\n\nWhether used or not, the coalstone burns out in time, crumbling into a fine black dust. The length of time the coalstone burns depends on the size of the diamond component. In any case, the coalstone burns at a rate of 1 day/gp value of the original stone, with a maximum of 1 year/level of the caster.\n\nWhen the magic-user casts this spell, he must grip both the burning coal and the diamond in his fist as if crushing them. He must be bare handed and will take 1 hp damage per round of casting time, unless protected against fire. Coalstone can be used to ignite any commonly flammable material in one round (e.g., oil, tinder, candles, and torches). Such stones can also be dropped into a pot or cup for cooking purposes (the stone is not extinguished by immersion in liquid), or be carried in a fireproof container for warmth."

The individual rocks are generally about as large as the caster's head.\n\nUsually used to mark a grave, a cairn spell can be employed to create a trail marker, as a means to reach a high window, or to bury food or other items that must be hidden or kept secure from pilferage. It can also, of course, be used as a weapon, crushing a creature under the arriving stones for 4d6 points of damage. The rocks fall with little force; a creature struck is allowed saving throw vs. spell for half damage.\n\nThe material component for a cairn spell is a handful of pebbles. These can be of any type or size, so long as at least eight pebbles fit into the caster's cupped palm.\n\nNotes: Granted by Ilmater, the One Who Endures, of the Forgotten Realms setting. This spell is found only in a few exceptionally rare tomes."

        "Introduction": "By means of this spell, the caster is able to summon certain aerial creatures to his location. Naturally, this spell works only outdoors, but not necessarily only at high altitudes. The caster begins the incantation and continues uninterrupted until some called creature appears or two turns have elapsed. (The verbalization and somatic gesturing's are easy, so this is not particularly exhausting to the spellcaster.) Only one type of the following sorts of beings can be summoned by the spell. They come only if they are within range of the call.\n\nThe caster can call three times, for a different type each time. Once a call is successful, no other type can be called without another casting of the spell. (The DM consults his outdoor map or bases the chance of any such creature being within spell range upon the caster's altitude and the terrain the caster is above at the time of spellcasting.)\n\nThe creature(s) called by the spell are allowed a saving throw vs. spell with a -4 penalty to avoid the summons. Aerial beings answering the call are favorably disposed to the spellcaster and give whatever aid they can. However, if the caller or members of the caller's party are of evil alignment, the creatures are allowed another saving throw vs. spell, this time with a +4 bonus, when they come within 10 yards of the caster or an evil individual with him. These beings immediately seek to escape if their saving throws are successful. In any event, if the caster requests that the summoned creatures engage in combat on his behalf, they are required to roll a loyalty reaction check based on the caster's Charisma and whatever dealings he has had with them.\n\nThis spell works with respect to neutral or good aerial creatures, as determined by the DM. Thus, the DM can freely add to or alter the list as he sees fit.\n\nIf the caster personally knows a certain individual aerial being, that being can be summoned at double the normal range. If this is done, no other aerial creatures are affected.\n\nIf a percentage chance is given in the accompanying table, halcyons and winged elves add 1% per caster level. These chances can be used if no other campaign information on the area is available.\n\nThe material components of this spell are three feathers from three different winged—not necessarily avian-species.\n\nNotes: Granted by the elven goddess Aerdrie Faenya."

Once most of the animals or birds arrive, the spell lasts for three rounds, plus one round per caster level. During this time, the called animals (or birds) are charmed; they will stay and not harm the calling druid or other animals or birds called. They act normally with respect to other creatures, fighting if attacked as if they were cornered; no other control is evident to onlookers without the use of further spells (such as, detect charm). After the spell has expired, the called animals or birds return to their normal territories, the charm lifted. The spell typically calls 3d6 creatures with 1/4 HD or less, or 2d6 creatures with 1/2 HD or less.\n\nThe material components are two handfuls of food appropriate to the type creatures summoned: the food is eaten by the animals (or birds) called.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell for druids and similar specialty priests.

The duration is measured from the time the pack arrives, not from when the call was issued.\n\nAffected ghost packs become tame and loyal, not obsessive and suicidal.

They never obey suicidal commands.\n\nAs a general rule, in any place where a ghost pack can be found (towns, farmland, etc.) there is still only a 25% chance of such a pack actually existing.

They are more intelligent than normal war dogs (rated as Low), and are capable of understanding complex instructions.\n\nThe call hounds spell cannot be dispelled. It ends if the hounds are slain or subjected to a banishment spell, if the caster is slain or rendered unconscious, or if the caster wills the spell to cease. Protection from good and similar effects can keep the hounds at bay. If the hounds are ordered to perform a task that contradicts the tenets of their patron Power, they simply vanish, ending the spell.\n\nThe spell requires the caster's holy symbol and a silver dog whistle worth at least 50 gp, which the caster sounds during casting.

The creature must be within range of the spell for the full duration of the tune (1 turn), or the spell fails.\n\nThereafter, the caster can summon the creature by playing the tune again. This power works regardless of the distance separating the two, but the creature can resist the effect by making a successful saving throw vs. spell. The creature can try to break free of the control once every turn, and is affected only for as long as the caster keeps playing the tune.\n\nFor as long as the creature is drawn to the caster (until a successful saving throw or until the caster stops playing), it moves towards the caster's location at a moderate speed (walking quickly but not running, trotting a horse but not galloping, etc.), attempting to evade any obstructions in its path. The creature is capable of speech, but speaks slowly, as if drunk or very tired, and is capable of hatching basic, simple plans to get to the caster (for example, hiring a ferry across a river, bribing a gate guard to enter a city, etc.). However, the creature does not act against its alignment.\n\nThroughout this, the creature can hear the melody in its head, and is aware only of an overriding urge to go in a particular direction. It is unaware of the reason for this compulsion, or the eventual destination.\n\nAs with the haunting melody spell, the shaman can maintain contact with only one creature. If the spell is cast on a second creature, the link with the previous creature is lost.\n\nThe spell requires an instrument with which the caster is proficient an on which the tune is played. The other components are the sound made by the instrument and the movements required to play it.\n\nNotes: Restricted to shamans; uncommon."

        "Introduction": "The ceremony spell represents certain functions carried out by religious organizations, and has various applications, depending on the level of the priest. A ceremony does not leave behind an aura of magic (although in some cases an aura of good or evil might be present and thus detectable).and the effects of a ceremony cannot be dispelled. Specific ceremonies vary from religion to religion, but usually encompass these functions:\n\nEach of these varieties of the ceremony spell requires a priest of the indicated/level or a higher one, with additional restrictions as described below. All ceremony spells except anathematize have no saving throw, since the recipient is either inanimate or presumed to be willing; these simply fail if performed on someone who is unwilling to receive the benefit. Briefly, the ceremonies listed do the following things:\n\nComing of age is a limited form of bless spell that is performed upon a young man (and in some cultures a young woman) at some point relatively early in life, often the age of 12. A young person who under goes this ceremony receives a +1 bonus to any single saving throw, which can be taken at any time after the coming of age ceremony is completed. In some cultures, the coming of age ceremony has a symbolic significance, such that an adolescent must receive this blessing before he or she can enjoy the rights and privileges of adulthood.\n\nBurial magically protects a corpse, and bestows it with the blessing of the religious organization. The body is shielded for one week as if by a protection from evil spell, and anyone trying to disinter the corpse within that time must make a saving throw vs. spell or stop and flee in fear for one turn.\n\nMarriage has no tangible after-effect (it does not guarantee happiness or harmony), but it usually carries a moral or legal significance, not dissimilar to the various rites of marriage that are performed in our real world.\n\nDedication allows the recipient of the spell to be taken into the ranks of the performing priest's religion, making that person a sanctioned worshiper of the priest's deity. The effect of a dedication is permanent, unless the worshiper demonstrates a desire to change allegiance to a different deity. In such a case, the earlier dedication can be overridden by a new dedication performed by a priest of a higher level than the one who performed the previous dedication.\n\nInvestiture must be performed on any aspiring priest before that individual can achieve the status of a 1st level priest.\n\nConsecrate item must be performed on any object to be placed on an altar or in some other location within a religious edifice. Holy (or unholy) water must be kept in a properly consecrated container, to prevent it from losing its potency.\n\nOrdination must be performed on a priest before the individual can assume responsibility for a congregation or assume similar duties, and even an adventuring priest must be ordained before he or she can gain followers and establish a following or other sort of group. In all cases, the priest performing the ordination must be of higher level than the recipient; this ceremony is often conducted as part of the training a priest receives in order to advance from 2nd to 3rd level.\n\nSpecial vows can be received by a would-be paladin or knight before that individual embarks upon a career in the desired profession. The effects last for as long as it takes the individual to gain enough experience points to rise to the upper limit of the current level. The special vows can then be renewed as part of the individual's training between levels, or at any time during advancement through the next higher level. A paladin who has received special vows is immune to the effects of bestow curse spells (but not cursed items) for as long as the special vows remain in effect. Additionally, this ceremony renders the subject more susceptible (-4 on saving throw) to any quest spell cast upon him or her by a priest of the same alignment as the one who performed the special vows ceremony.\n\nConsecrate ground should be performed upon an area before any holy (unholy) structure is built on the site. A religious edifice constructed on ground that has not been consecrated will slowly but irrevocably fall into a state of disrepair, having a 1% chance per year cumulative, of actually collapsing as a result of this oversight. This ceremony must be performed before the area in question is altered in any way (for example, landscaping) and before any construction materials are brought to the site; it has no effect if it is done as an afterthought. Consecrate ground can be used on a plot of land destined for use as a graveyard, and in such a case the graveyard itself automatically turns undead each round with the same effectiveness as a 3rd level cleric. (Or, if the consecration of a would-be graveyard is performed by an evil cleric, any undead creatures occupying the area are treated as if they were being protected and controlled by an evil cleric of 3rd level.)\n\nAnathematize is a form of excommunication by means of which the offender is literally branded on the cheek, forehead, arm, or hand with a symbol. sigil, or sign that identifies the subject (to those who understand the symbol) as someone who has committed a serious offense in the eyes of his or her deity. An unwilling subject of this spell is allowed a saving throw vs. spell, at -4, to escape its effects. If the recipient is not truly deserving of the telling brand, the ceremony fails when performed. A successful atonement causes the brand to fade, and possibly vanish. If the offending actions were caused magically or by some other external force, the brand utterly disappears. If the offending actions were willful, the brand cannot be completely removed.\n\nThe components for the various ceremony spells vary from religion to religion, but the material component always involves the use of the cleric's holy symbol in one way or another.\n\nStandard costs for performing these ceremonies are as follows: coming of age, 5-15 sp; burial 5-50 gp; marriage, 1-20 gp; dedication, 1-10 sp (or sometimes free); investiture, 1-100 gp (or sometimes free); consecrate item, usually free; ordination, usually free but possibly as much as 200 gp, special vows, 1-100 gp (or sometimes free); consecrate ground, 100-600 gp depending on the size of the area and the level of the priest; and anathematize is always performed at no charge, since this ceremony is always deemed to be in the best interests of the priest's religion.\n\nNotes: Common for clerics.",
        "Other Clerical Ceremonies": "These ceremonies have been published in Dragon Magazine as spells. Here, they are presented as additional ceremonies.\n\n3rd level cleric: bless newborn\n\n7th level cleric: desecrate ground\n\nBless Newborn: This ceremony protects a new-born infant from possession and other ill effects. It must be performed within 14 days of birth and the effects last for 6 months. A protected infant has a saving throw bonus of +2 against any form of possession. Further, the infant will not be stolen by faerie folk or replaced by a changeling. The usual cost for the ceremony is 2-5 gp.\n\nDesecrate Ground: This ceremony, the reverse of the consecrate ground ceremony, is generally used against a building or area consecrated to an opposing alignment. It goes beyond mere physical pollution or defilement, the affected area requires extensive ritual purification before an attempt can be made to reconsecrate it. Any general alignment-based bonuses the site provides are reduced or negated. Further, a desecrated building is 1% likely per year to collapse; this chance is not cumulative.\n\nThis ceremony is also used by evil priests to remove the protections placed on burial grounds. This makes those buried within more vulnerable to animation, and makes those interred later 5% likely to become restless spirits of some type. Further, any priest in the burial ground and attempting to turn its undead operates as if two levels lower than he or she actually is. There is, of course, no charge."

        "Introduction": "The druidic ceremony is similar to the priest version, having a number of applications within the hierarchy of druids. The ceremony spell does not leave behind an aura of magic (although a know alignment spell or similar magic might reveal the force of true neutrality involved), and the effect cannot be dispelled. Druidic ceremonies include the following, which can be performed by a druid of the indicated or higher level:\n\nThe characteristics of the various types of druidic ceremony spells are as follows:\n\nComing of age is performed upon young people in druidic societies, usually when they reach the age of 14, and is symbolic of the young man's or young woman's entrance into adulthood. A young person receives a +1 bonus to any single saving throw, which can be taken at any time after the coming of age ceremony is completed. The coming of age ceremony has a symbolic significance in that the adolescent can thereafter enjoy the rights and privileges of adulthood.\n\nRest eternal is performed upon the body of a deceased creature, and hastens the journey of the soul/spirit to its final resting place. The spirit of the deceased will not return to haunt the living\n\nMarriage is essentially identical to the clerical ceremony of the same name.\n\nDedication allows the recipient of the spell to be taken into the ranks of the druid's followers/worshipers, provided the individual has a neutral alignment. A recipient of this spell is charged, as are druids, with the responsibility to preserve and protect nature and the balance of forces in the world.\n\nInvestiture must be performed upon an individual of true neutral alignment before he or she can become a 1st level druid).\n\nInitiation imbues the druid with the shape-changing and immunity to woodland charm powers that become available upon attaining 7th level. This ceremony must be performed upon a druid immediately after he or she begins to advance upward through the 7th level of experience; if cast earlier than this, it does not work, and the druid does not have the benefit of the above-mentioned special powers until receiving initiation. Usually, a druid must seek out another druid of 7th or higher level to perform the ceremony, but in unusual cases a druid can cast it upon himself or herself.\n\nSpecial vows is a ceremony that operates in the same fashion as the clerical rite of the same name. It does not work upon paladins, but will function upon cavaliers of any alignment.\n\nHallowed ground is cast by the druid on his or her permanent grove. This ceremony ensorcelled the trees of the grove so that they will never be affected by disease or other natural disasters. The ground remains hallowed for as long as the druid maintains this grove as his or her permanent base.\n\nCast out is a form of excommunication or punishment that can be performed by a druid upon someone who has committed sacrilege upon the natural environment or in some other way violated the principles and standards of druids. Its effects can be lessened at a later date by the casting of a reversed version of this ceremony, either by the same druid another one of at least as high a level as the original caster, but the casting out can never be completely neutralized except by a Hierophant Druid of any level. An individual who has been cast out exudes a powerful negative aura, causing any natural creature encountered to react negatively to the individual. This includes all normal (nonmagical) animals, monsters native to the woodlands, domesticated beasts such as horses and dogs, and all druids and their followers.\n\nCasting out is a very powerful form of punishment, and can only be performed by a druid who has received permission from his or her Arch druid to do so. Similarly, an Arch druid must get permission from the Great Druid, and the Great Druid from the Grand Druid. The Grand Druid does not need to obtain permission, but his or her actions can be reversed by a Hierophant Druid at any time. This ceremony is usually only used on occasions where the severity of an offense warrants such extreme punishment; a druid who asks for and is denied permission to perform it, or one who later has his or her actions offset by another druid, may be subject to punishment by higher-ranking members of the hierarchy. An intended recipient of this ceremony who is unwilling receives a saving throw vs. spell, at -4, to negate its effects.\n\nThe components of a ceremony spell always include mistletoe, and the rite (of any sort) must be performed in a druid grove or some other natural, healthy patch of forest. Such ceremonies are normally conducted at either dawn or dusk, the times when night and day are in balance.\n\nNotes: Restricted to druids, common.",
        "Other Druidic Ceremonies": "These ceremonies have been published in Dragon Magazine and other sources as spells. Here, they have been reconfigured as additional ceremonies.\n\n3rd level druid: witness\n\n14th level druid: anointing\n\nWitness: Within their society, druids are legal officials as well as religious leaders. Having a druid witness an oath makes it binding. The oath taker pronounces the vow, usually an act to be completed within a specified time, calling upon the powers that be, and specifying a penalty if the oath goes unfulfilled. Alter the ceremony is completed, the oath taker must fulfill his literal word, or suffer the consequences. The druid may advise the against rash promises or suggest suitable modifications to an oath, but the final say is the oath takers. After an oath is witnessed, nothing more can be done about it. Warriors often take oaths to perform certain deeds. While an unfulfilled oath may be binding for years, the death of the oath taker breaks all but the most terrible oaths.\n\nAnointing (14th level): This ceremony is used to raise kings, high level druids, and other important persons to their stations. In the Celtic view of things. Sovereignty is a goddess to be wooed and wedded. The candidate is expected to make offerings to the holy groves, conduct great sacrifices, and give away vast amounts of wealth to the poor to please his bride. Displays of the candidate's physical prowess lead up to the anointing. Finally, the anointing takes place. If the candidate proves himself good, wise, liberal, and powerful, he is accepted by the Sovereignty, and is allowed to take up his station. At Tara, the kingstone upon which the new High King stood was supposed to cry out for the true king when he stood upon it. (King Arthur's pulling the sword from the stone is much the same.)\n\nWhile the anointing is the seal of station, disputes can arise about whether a person is the rightful possessor of the office. A successful anointing raises the recipient's Wisdom and Charisma by one point each (to a maximum of 18). The saving throw for this spell is special.\n\nAssuming the candidate is properly qualified, he is rated on a scale of 1-4 (1 being highest) in each of Five areas by the DM. The rating in each area is added, generating a saving throw of 5 to 20. If the number or above is rolled on 1d20, the individual is confirmed as not only the lawful, but the rightful possessor of the office.\n\nAlignment: Has the recipient displayed good character and faithfulness to the druidic cult?\n\nDuty: Has the recipient shown himself responsible and reliable in all his past dealings, and loyal to the kingdom, sect, or organization?\n\nLeadership: Has the recipient been a strong and fair leader?\n\nPerformance: Did the candidate perform well in the rituals, games, demonstrations, offerings, and generosity during the festivities prior to his anointing?\n\nBreeding: Is the recipient of good family connections and does he act as befits his station?",
        "Seasonal Ceremonies": "''The seasonal spells of spring, summer, autumn, and winter have the following in common. These affect the land and people under the druid's care, large or small. (A druid is off on his own is in his own charge: a party of adventurers of the druidic religion also might be considered his charge.)''\n\n''A druid of insufficient level to conduct a seasonal ceremony is part of another druid's charge, as are the people and lands under the lower-level druid. The junior druid must participate in the ceremony conducted by the senior druid for those in his charge to benefit. The lower-level druid is expected to conduct the ceremonies of which he is capable and to attend and assist when senior druids conduct seasonal ceremonies that he cannot). Failure in either case could mean disaster for the druid's charges.''\n\n''These ceremonies are all-night affairs, during which the druids keep vigil, chant, make offerings, and perform certain actions important to the community's or kingdom's welfare for the coming year. Ordinary worshipers are also participants, although the druids do much of their work withdrawn from the masses (and in secret).''\n\n\n * 5th level druid: Spring (Beltane)\n * 7th level druid: Summer (Lugnasad)\n * 9th level druid: Autumn (Samain)\n * 12th level druid: Winter (Imbalc)\n\nSpring: The spring festival (Beltane) celebrates the sun's power to give life. Great fires are lit, and cattle are passed between them. Druids and people process between the fires, waving shoots of grain. The fiery sun is associated with health and the destruction of disease: The main point of this festival is to ensure protection from disease for animals, crops, and the faithful. The ceremony reduces the chance of disease for the year to come by 10%. Beltane is a major civic festival associated with the spring planting.\n\nSummer: The summer festival (Lugnasad) begins with the all-night vigil of Midsummer, the shortest night of the year. All is in full flower Those involved in the ceremony wear garlands, which are later offered as sacrifices, beginning on Midsummer's Eve. This is the night when druids gather their mistletoe for the coming year. Each druid must gather his own mistletoe on this night for his spells to work at full potency during the next year. A druid who cannot perform the summer ceremony must join with other druids, or the mistletoe he gathers will be nothing more than lesser mistletoe. The penalty for neglecting this festival is a loss of spell potency throughout the coming year. On the night of the first full moon following Midsummer, great fairs are opened.\n\nAutumn: The autumn harvest festival (Samain) is a time of feasting. All the folk assemble to offer their first fruits to the gods. Great bonfires are built on prominent hills, and dancing and drinking go on all night. The harvest's bounty is meant to stave off hunger in the winter. Neglecting this festival brings dearth and poverty for the coming year (extra expenses will be accrued, various treasure collected will be deficient in value, etc.). (The DM handles this condition of misfortune until the next Samain. A monthly loss of at least 100 gp per level is suggested.)\n\nWinter: The winter festival (Imbalc) celebrates lambing season, and offerings of milk are in order. Like a lamb, the year is born as the sun begins to wax again. The ceremony takes place on Yule, the longest night of the year—this, the longest seasonal ceremony is a petition for strength. Neglecting the ceremony produces a -5% penalty in experience points earned for the next year and the Hit Dice of animals born in the new year have a penalty of-1 hit point per Hit Die."

Commonly assumed forms include that of a dolphin or narwhal. The caster gains all of the chosen creature's abilities except for innate magical abilities, magic resistance, and those abilities dependent upon Intelligence.\n\nThe caster also adopts the form's vulnerabilities. For example, a priest who becomes a dolphin still cannot breathe out of the water for more than 24 hours. Like the shapechange spell, a priest who is killed while in another form does not revert to his or original shape, which may disallow certain types of revivification.\n\nThe caster can change forms as many times as desired within the duration of the spell. For example. she can into a dolphin while swimming in shallow seas, then to a sperm whale to dive to great depths. The first form adapted has whatever hit points the casting priest had at the time of the casting of the cetacean form spell, and subsequent forms carry the current total hit points with them. Each alteration in form takes only a second, and no system shock survival roll is required.\n\nThe material component is a small pinch of ambergris and the priest's holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Granted by the sea elf god.

A chain creation spell fails if it is cast later than a turn after those other magics, or if cast on anything involving active undeath.\n\nThe three copies produced by this spell last just as long as the copied item (that is, the length of existence is governed by the original magic, from a few rounds to permanent). Permanent items created by this spell are independently permanent and not destroyed by the destruction of the original.\n\nThe material components of a chain creation spell are three rubies of any size worth a total of at least 100 gp, crushed during casting, or the powder of four rubies (worth the same amount), prepared beforehand.\n\nNotes: Granted by Lathander Morninglord of the Forgotten Realms setting.

        "Introduction": "This spell allows a priest to create insanity in the mind of a target creature, which then becomes contagious. A creature must have an Intelligence score of 5 or above to be subject to the effects of chain madness. When the priest casts the spell, the target creature is allowed a saving throw vs. spell with a -4 penalty to avoid the effects. These effects are not immediately obvious; there is a minimum latency period of 48 hours. After this time, the afflicted creature must make a daily Wisdom check and, when this fails, the creature develops the symptoms of a fevered, agitated, severe depression.\n\nAn affected creature has a -3 penalty to all attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. The creature must also make a successful Wisdom check to perform any premeditated action (as decided by the DM). For example, a creature fights as best it can to defend itself if attacked, but a Wisdom check is required to initiate an aggressive action of its own, plan a trap or ambush, and so on.\n\nThe duration of the madness is 1d4+4 days, but at the end of this time the creature must make a system shock roll. If this fails, the insanity continues for a further 1d4+4 days. This continues until a successful system shock roll is made or the creature dies. A creature that fails an initial system shock roll loses 1 point of Constitution permanently for each subsequent system shock roll failure. A creature reduced to 0 Constitution dies.\n\nThe great danger of chain madness lies in its contagion. Each affected creature can infect up to six other creatures per day. The effect spreads through physical contact, including during the original latency period. Even a shake of a hand is enough to convey the madness. Each potential secondary victim is permitted a saving throw vs. spell to negate the effect. If affected, secondary victims develop the same madness after the same latency period and are themselves contagious. However, tertiary victims save vs. spell at +1, later victims save at +2, and so on along the chain.\n\nChain madness can be cured by a successful dispel magic spell, a remove curse, or a heal spell. Detection spells that read a creature's nature (for example, know alignment, detect good/evil) have a 5% chance per level of the caster to reveal that something is subtly wrong in the mind of an affected creature. This may be crucial to containing the outbreak when the malady is still in its latency phase.\n\nThis spell is rarely used, for it is hazardous to the priest casting it. If the casting priest rolls below his Wisdom score on d 100 when casting the spell, then he suffers the effects of chain madness, but without becoming contagious.\n\nThe material component for this spell is a small vial of brain tissue from an illithid.\n\nNotes: Granted by Iuz the Evil of the World of Greyhawk setting."

It causes a pair of spectral jaws, or rather, rings of floating fangs, arranged as if fixed in invisible jaws, to appear out of the caster's hand or chest and fly at a desired target at MV Fl 15 (A). The fangs have no Armor Class or physical solidity. They can be destroyed only by dispel magic or certain magical barriers and powerful spells. They strike twice per round at the caster's THAC0 and operate independently of the caster. (In other words, the caster can engage in other spellcasting, attacks, or activities while the fangs attack a chosen target.) The target can be changed by the caster with a momentary, silent exertion of will at the end of the first round of the existence of the fangs, but not otherwise. (That is. the fangs bite at two opponents twice, or one target four times).\n\nThe fangs do nothing (until redirected) if their chosen target dies or uses any sort of teleportation magic to vanish. The fangs can detect and attack invisible creatures, even when their caster cannot; but the caster must have some indication that an invisible creature is present to direct the fangs to attack. The bite of these fangs inflicts 2d4 points of damage (save for half), as an energy-stealing attack rather than a physical ravaging. The fangs are able to penetrate any physical protection up to and including plate armor.\n\nThe material component of a chant of fangs spell is a tooth from any wild mammalian predator (that is, one not slain while in captivity or reared domestically).\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil god Malar the Beastlord of the Forgotten Realms setting.

It creates lingering doubts in the captor's minds that make them think that the caster is worth ransoming, that higher authorities should be consulted, or in the case of evil beings, that it might be more fun to forcibly interrogate the caster later. In any case, if the spell is successful, the caster is not killed immediately, thus allowing a possible escape. Even creatures of animal intelligence or less are easily distracted from the caster—for example, other creatures available for consumption are eaten first.\n\nThe charm of Brandobaris does not affect the caster's ability to communicate with his or her captors, nor does it otherwise alter their behavior. It does not, for example, make guards less watchful than usual.\n\nThe effect is centered on the caster, and affects beings selected by the caster within the area of effect. If the spell is cast at three beings, each gets a normal saving throw vs. spell. If only two beings are to be affected, each has a -1 saving throw penalty. If the spell is cast at one being, the saving throw has a -2 penalty. Saving throws are adjusted for Wisdom.\n\nThe verbal component of this spell varies according to the situation, but typically the charm of Brandobaris is invoked with a comment along the lines of: “This isn't exactly what it looks like. . .” or “Let me explain ...”\n\nNotes: Granted by the halfling god, Brandobaris."

The priests stand or sit in a circle (two priests position themselves face-to-face, while three make a triangle) so that they are within arms' reach of each other. They then close their eyes and concentrate. The DM may rule that both priests must follow the same deity, or they may be followers of allied deities.\n\nThe spell's magic changes the appearance of each priest into some natural terrain feature for as long as the priests maintain their concentration. The terrain feature is dictated by the deity worshiped and the situation (a priest of Erik in a forest, for example, might look like a tree, but might appear to be a cactus in the desert).\n\nWhile the spell lasts, the priests look, feel, and smell like the object of their transformation. They remain aware of their surroundings and are able to hear and smell activities around them. They do not actually polymorph into these magical forms, however. A priest who assumes the form of a boulder, for example, can feel rough or smooth like a boulder, but isn't actually as hard as rock.\n\nAll passersby, even those searching for the priests, are affected by the magic. Unless greatly motivated, they will assume that these “natural” features are normal for the landscape. Characters who dispute the change in the landscape (“Hey, that boulder wasn't here a minute ago!”) are allowed a saving throw versus spell with a -1 bonus\n\nfor every priest participating in the circle of secrets. If the character succeeds, he knows the natural features weren't there previously (but does not actually see the priests); failure means the individual dismisses his or her suspicions.\n\nIn addition to their own forms, the casting priests can affect one additional individual for every two priests casting the spell. These additional individuals stand between the priests or within the circle and change shape along with the priests. These beings need not concentrate or remain still, but cannot move out of their places.\n\nAny participant moves significantly or breaks the circle, reverts to normal. As long as two or more priests maintain their concentration, however, the rest of the circle remains disguised, no matter how many beings are enclosed. Thus, six priests could cast the spell to include three allies, then four of the priests could move away to pursue other activities. Two priests must remain in concentration to safeguard themselves and the three allies.\n\nA true seeing spell or gem can penetrate a circle of secrets. Detect magic shows only that magic is present, but not the nature of the magic.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for priests from Cerilia, the Birthright setting."

The ravens faithfully carry out the instructions of the priest, so far as their intelligence allows. They can follow simple instructions, such as: “Follow those fleeing figures and attack them,” or instructions to trail a target and report back to the priest, but not complex or abstract ones. The DM determine the actions of ravens according to their Intelligence. Giant ravens (Intelligence 5-7) are capable of cunning maneuvers, such as following a party of adventurers while staying a safe distance away from ranged attacks, and peeling off at a rate of one per hour or so to report back to the summoning priest.\n\nThe flock of ravens summoned by the clawcloud spell returns to a wild, self-determined state on the first dawn following their summoning. The material component is a raven's feather.\n\nNotes: Granted by Iuz the Evil of the World of Greyhawk setting."

A “hearth” might be as small as a beggar's shack, or as large as a whole farmstead (including barns and outbuildings) or a royal palace, but it must be the residence of a single family. The spell's casting time is therefore approximate: it takes only one round to cleanse a small shack, but might take a whole day for a palace. Shamans can shorten the casting time by enlisting the aid of other shamans.\n\nTo cast the spell, the shaman and any assistants first take supple boughs and clumps of leafy plants. Thus armed, they rampage around the dwelling, shouting threats and calling down curses upon any spirit that might resist them. Lashing at the air with their boughs, they strike at the walls, floors and beams, and items of furniture. Any weapons, people, or domestic animals inside the home they beat with clumps of plants, while ornaments are shaken and clothes flung about. Nothing is left untouched. Furniture is emptied, sides of meat beaten against each other and sacks of grain torn open. In this way, the shamans charge around the house, driving the spirits out.\n\nSpirits whose Hit Dice exceed the caster's level, are unaffected. Each other spirit in the home is allowed a saving throw vs. spell. If successful. the spirit must leave for 2d6 weeks; failure means the spirit is driven out and cannot return.\n\nNote that the spell also affects spirits possessing people and domestic beasts in the home (provided that they are present when the spell is cast), as well as those inhabiting buildings or objects there. If for any reason the shamans fail to beat any room, animal, person or object in the house, then any spirits possessing that thing remain unaffected by the spell. Spirits living in the rooms without possessing any particular object, and those in wild animals (like mice) inside the house, are all affected by the spell. However, the spell has no effect on bound spirits, like fetish spirits bound into objects, or spirits that naturally live in plants or animals.\n\nThe material components for the spell are simply the branches and plants used to beat the spirits away.\n\nNotes: Restricted to shamans, uncommon."

This also applies to trees of life and magical fruit trees, but only if cleared water is used to nurture the trees for every day of their growing life.\n\nThe material component is a single drop of distilled water.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, muddy water, has exactly the opposite effect. Creatures must drink twice as much and plants yield half as much. The effects of muddy water are not readily apparent—creatures may think they are taking their fill of water but find themselves suffering from dehydration anyway; farmers may not realize until the crops are in and it's too late.\n\nThe material component of the reverse is a rotted seed.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for priests from the Dark Sun setting."

When either of the triggering conditions occurs, the following happen:\n\nA system shock survival roll, if required, is automatically successful, regardless of the creature's Constitution.\n\nThe creature regenerates severed or missing limbs or body extremities.\n\nThe cloak purges the body of all poisons, diseases, insanity, charms and outside mental influences, curses and geas effects, possession or symbiotic life (even if friendly and desired), and feeblemindedness. It also cancels the effects of forget spells previously cast on the being;\n\nThe creature is restored to full wakefulness, alertness, sobriety, and a pain-free state.\n\nThe cloak heals 4d8 hit points of damage.\n\nIf this spell is cast on a hurt creature within 2 rounds of an injury major enough to activate the cloak, the spell has the effects noted above, and allows a being who has failed a system shock survival roll a second chance. This roll is made at a +22% bonus. Failure means death occurs, but the purge and regenerate effects occur to the corpse.\n\nIf this spell is applied 3 to 9 rounds after a being has been stricken, it allows a second system shock survival roll, but without any bonus; other spell effects occur as noted here. If the spell is applied later, it only purges and regenerates (even on bodies).\n\nThe spell's material components are four drops each of holy water, the caster's blood, and dew. A dispel magic cannot end this spell if it has not been activated. This magic has enabled many dead drow to return and hunt down foes. Certain drow wizards are rumored to use a similar spell.\n\nNotes: Granted by the drow goddess Lolth."

If cast over a sewer or garbage heap, the spell doubles the filth created. The cloud itself lasts for only one round per level, but the effects are nonmagical and permanent until magically purified or negated by time (though flowing water also tends to eliminate the effects relatively quickly). This spell can spoil a castle's water supply or foul a small river. Depending upon what the caster uses this spell for, it may well require a Ravenloft powers check.\n\nNotes: Common on the Demiplane of Dread; used mostly by evil priests."

A creature flying through a cloud at the moment the cloud solidifies is allowed a saving throw vs. petrifaction. Success means the creature escapes: failure means the creature is trapped as the cloud solidifies around it. However, as the cloud is porous, such creatures can continue to breathe until the spells duration elapses.\n\nThe solidified cloud itself continues to drift with the wind as usual.

Simply getting all the trees to start moving, stop moving, or change direction at the same time requires conscientious planning and several hours to execute (a minimum of one hour per mile the treant noble is from the farthest edge of the forest.) So, while trees commanded in this way theoretically have all the abilities of any other treant-animated trees, speaking practically they can be commanded only to move, and the full movement capability of the trees is rarely employed by the commanding noble. A forest charging full tilt across the countryside could get into trouble before the noble became aware there was a problem.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell, known to treants.

Local spirits are those with limited range and power—lesser spirits (as listed in the Monster section)—the spirits of a particular tree, rock, or stream are typical lesser nature spirits. A spirit that haunts a single building or compound could also be contacted.\n\nThe spirit of a mountain or river is greater than a lesser spirit and is beyond the power of this spell. To contact the spirit, the shukenja must know its identity (which can be obtained through a trance spell) and must be within 10 feet of the area where the spirit is found.\n\nOnce the spirit is contacted, the shukenja can ask it one question for every level of experience he has gained. The questions must be specific and clearly worded, but are not limited to yes or no answers. The spirit answers questions literally and does not volunteer any information. The answers are always correct if the answer is known. Good spirits attempt to be as helpful as possible within the limits of the question, neutral spirits answer in riddling or roundabout ways, and evil spirits always try to distort the answer based on the wording of the question.\n\nThe spirit can only answer those questions concerning the immediate area it affects. Questions beyond the scope of the spirit are wasted. Thus, the spirit of a great tree in the village could not answer questions about events outside the village, and a ghost haunting a temple could not discuss events not related to the temple or its reasons for haunting it. The DM must decide if any question is within the realm of the local spirit. The DM can, if he chooses, limit the use of this spell to once a week (or even less) for any particular spirit, since they do not care to be disturbed by the trifling affairs of the material world.\n\nThe material components of this spell are incense and an offering appropriate to the nature of the spirit.\n\nNotes: Common for priests from an oriental setting: otherwise, very rare."

A creature with fewer Hit Dice or levels than the shukenja has a -4 penalty applied to this roll. Those of equal through 150% more Hit Dice or levels have a normal saving throw. Those with greater than 150% have a +4 bonus.\n\nA successful saving throw means the spell has no effect. Failure means creature's alignment immediately becomes whatever the shukenja states. Accompanying this change of alignment is a change in the creature's behavior to match its new world-view. Thus, a lawful evil NPC changed to lawful good alignment immediately gives up his evil ways, disassociates from his less-than-savory companions, and tries to atone for his past misdeeds.\n\nIf the change is outside the alignments allowed by the subject's current class, the individual does not lose any class-based abilities and can still advance in level. This is a special case, since the deity has seen fit to make the alteration through its shukenja servant. It is quite likely, however, that the individual will use such abilities in a manner quite different from the norm. A ninja changed to good alignment would use her ninja powers against those seeking to cause evil or harm, often doing so without pay or reward.\n\nThe material components for this spell are the shukenja's holy symbol and a set of coarse white robes to be given to the subject once the spell has taken effect.\n\nNotes: Common for priests from oriental settings; otherwise, very rare."

The caster must offer suitable inducements, or the greater elemental is 10% likely to depart to its home plane.\n\nThe material component of the spell (besides a great the quantity of the element at hand) is a small amount of one of the following:\n\nAir Elemental: Burning incense\n\nEarth Elemental: Soft clay\n\nFire Elemental: Sulphur and phosphorus\n\nWater Elemental: Water and sand\n\nSpecial protection from elementals is available by means of a protection from evil spell.\n\n\n * * Any casting is 5% likely to summon the next more powerful elemental. The greater elemental is 1% likely per Hit Die to be free-willed. A 24th level caster will summon a greater elemental of demipower status, at least 24 Hit Dice and immune to weapons of less than +3 enchantment.\n\nFree-willed elementals of these power levels can be negotiated with, but tend to be more hostile and less tractable. Spells such as exaction and oathbinding might be useful.\n\nNotes: Common for elemental specialty priests; otherwise rare."

        "Introduction": "This spell is most often used to illuminate temples or temporary places of worship. Continual faerie fire allows a priest to cover an area with a pale, glowing light. This radiance can be of any color desired by the caster. Amber, green, red, ale-brown, and purple, in that order, seem the most popular. Crafty spellcasters sometimes employ blue-white or specific aura hues to simulate magical auras. The spell's area of effect can be of any size up to the limit imposed by the priest's level, but it must be continuous. A row of patches of light the size of coins would require a row of spells, whereas a ribbon or circle of light in the same area could be created with a single spell.\n\nWhen in contact with the lit area, all beings and objects are outlined with a slightly more intense light than their surroundings. Invisible creatures are also surrounded with a nimbus and revealed if in contact with continual faerie fire, but noncorporeal, ethereal, or gaseous creatures are unaffected. Undead creatures, however disguised, display an aura of blackness when in contact with continual faerie fire.\n\nAll creatures and objects possessing or under the current influence of cast magic that is not part of their essential nature radiate an additional flickering white aura. (The magic that animates some undead creatures is part of their essential nature; they would not cause a white aura unless they also bore some special magical item or cast dweomer.) Spellcasting or activating a magical item while in contact with the radiance of continual faerie fire is accompanied by tiny, winking white motes of light. (A flickering white aura is not displayed by beings that have only memorized spells and not yet cast them.) The white aura concentrates around magical items and surrounds beings under a dweomer. In other words, a magical sword or potion flask would display this flickering white aura, and the entire person of a polymorphed being would glow. The whole of any illusion also glows with this flickering white aura. Aura effects are cumulative: An undead creature imbued with spell ability or disguised by an illusion would have a black aura haloed with a flickering white one.\n\nThe radiance does not harm undead or creatures that dwell in darkness and doesn't approach the intensity of sunlight, but creatures with normal vision can attack and function as in normal light. The radiance does not alter or damage objects or creatures within its area of effect in any way. Moving objects and creatures retain a glowing outline for one round after they leave the area lit by the spell.\n\nContinual faerie fire operates independently of magical light and darkness, functioning as if neither existed. Within areas of bright light, the winking white lights of magical outlines are hard to see, and the colored outlines around beings and objects appear as a faint fuzziness around the perceived edges of their outlined forms.\n\nThe material components of this spell are a piece of foxfire, a drop of water, a pinch of ashes and pinch of bone dust.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for priests in the Forgotten Realms setting."

Even if no commands are sent, the spell wears off after a day.\n\nAlthough the creature must be within 40 feet of the necromancer when the spell is cast, after that the creature can travel up to a mile away and still receive commands. As you might expect, the spell will not function if the caster and undead minion are in different domains and the borders of either domain (or any intervening domain) are closed.\n\nThe material component of this spell is the tongue of a dead man. Casting this spell requires a Ravenloft powers check.\n\nNotes: Common for priests on the Demiplane of Dread; otherwise, known mostly by necromancer-priests."

If the spirits have reason to distrust the shaman, they may refrain from attending, but usually all those called arrive within one turn after the spell is completed.\n\nThereafter, the council is convened, the most respected spirit taking the lead in organizing the discussion. The spirits ask the shaman why he or she called them, and debate the issues put before them: Only important matters affecting the tribe's well-being, ancient evils, and epic quests are considered worthy of a council, and the spirits may punish shamans who call them to resolve petty, routine, or personal problems.\n\nOnce the council has begun, the shaman (as a mere mortal) is relegated to the sidelines, and is wise to be quiet unless the spirits (as his betters) ask for an opinion or information. The whole discussion often has a dreamlike quality—voices echoing, mists swirling, space and time becoming confused—and when the duration expires, the whole council simply fades away, leaving the shaman alone.\n\nThe material components of the spell are the markers that identify the spell's area, which crumble when the spell expires. Although they are not valuable, it takes several days or more to assemble them, and the cooperation of other members of the tribe is usually required (groups of hunters stalking rare animals whose skulls are needed, for example). The only other requirements for the spell are that there are no mortals besides the shaman present, and that the area chosen be on the tribe's own territory.\n\nNotes: Restricted to shamans, uncommon."

This last power operates against all insects in contact with the shroud. It is effective against creeping doom, insect plague, and other magically summoned or controlled insects, and exhausts the spell—in other words, it slays all insects in contact with it and then vanishes (providing no protection against other insects that may have accompanied those it destroyed but that were outside its area of effect). The crawling darkness spell can be ended instantly at any time by the caster's will.\n\nThe material components of this spell are a strand of spider web, a pinch of soot or pitch, and a tentacle of any size from an octopus, cuttlefish, jellyfish, or other marine life form.\n\nNotes: Granted by Shar, Mistress of the Night, of the Forgotten Realms setting.

Within a larger envelope of air (such as the deck of a spelljamming ship or the atmosphere of a planet), the freshened air will drift off, combining with the existing air.\n\nFor every two levels over first, the priest can create sufficient air for an additional person. A 3rd level priest can create air for two man-sized creatures, a 5th level priest sufficient air for five, and so on.

The caster can refresh the air within his own personal air envelope and that of others within the range of the spell, without needing to touch those individuals.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, destroy air, immediately reduces the air around one creature to fouled (-2 penalty to attacks and ability checks).\n\nIf the create air spell is used within a gravity field, inside otherwise hostile surroundings (such as inside a cloudkill or stinking cloud), it allows the recipient a single clean breath before the created air bubbles to the surface.\n\nThe material component for the spell is a small, stoppered flask.\n\nNotes: Common for priests from a spelljamming culture; otherwise, very rare.",

Then, a circle of dwarven priests linked by combine spells must cast commune, prayer, animate object, and finally, create machine, upon the device. A period of prayer, fasting, and meditation must be observed until the machine is enchanted, just as with any other magical items fabricated by priests (see the DMG).\n\nThe machine is nonintelligent and, when created, can be programmed to follow up to 10 simple orders (such machines are typically controlled by manual controls rather than by verbal commands).\n\nA device created by this spell functions without fail or error for centuries, never requiring major repair other than common-sense maintenance unless it has been severely damaged. Armor Class and hit point values for the machine are assigned by the DM. These vary with function and the materials used to construct the device: Armor Class 4 to Armor Class 1 and 30-50 hit points are typical. The cost of a machine is usually between 1,000 and 4,000 gp per hit point.\n\nThe power and range of abilities of any machine must be strictly regulated by the DM, just as with any other magical item created for the campaign. A machine comparable in power to an artifact can be created only by NPCs of legendary status. No machine with obvious military function can be made with this spell. An enchanted waterwheel that runs forever or an underground mining machine can be created, but not a magical siege machine or armored attack vehicle. Such powerful military machines come under the heading of artifacts, and so are usually beyond this spell's power and effects.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell, granted by some dwarven gods.

Generally, a mask affects either a single powerful spirit (6 or more Hit Dice), or a group of less notable spirits.\n\nThe caster must create the mask without the aid of others (and thus must have a proficiency in carpentry, pottery, or a similar field) and casts the spell as work progresses. The finished product must resemble the spirit it is designed for use with (at least symbolically), and is generally decorated with rare feathers, shells, bones, and similar materials. At the DM's discretion, a mask may require specific, rare decorations that may cost more, or even require the shaman to undertake a quest.\n\nWhen worn, the mask provides a -1 bonus to most rolls made by a shaman while interacting with the spirit or spirits for which the mask was designed. That means a +1 bonus for shamanic rituals. Charisma checks when using persuasion or guile, etc. It does not affect saving throws against powers wielded by the spirit.\n\nThe mask can only depict a spirit of the same alignment as the spirit that granted the shaman this spell. For example, if the casting shaman gained the spell from a lawful neutral spirit, he or she could only create masks designed to affect lawful neutral spirits.\n\nFurthermore, the spirits inevitably hold shamans responsible if the masks that they create are misused. Thus, most shamans create them only for their own use or the use of their tribe, and guard them well.\n\nThe material components are those items incorporated into the finished mask.

(The ceremony requires a single shamanic ritual proficiency check.) Every animal of the species sacrificed, within one mile of the caster, is then drawn to the site. They are thenceforth bound to the shaman, recognizing the shaman as their leader. Within one mile of the site, these creatures gain a higher-than normal intelligence (+1 Intelligence to their normal scores), though their natures remain unaltered (mice are timid, cats are curious, and so on). Offspring of such animals are similarly bound to the caster and endowed with these faculties.\n\nThe shaman gains the ability to communicate with the creatures, but only while within the sanctuary. He or she can understand their grunts, squeaks, etc., and they can understand his human speech.\n\nEach of the creatures can act as a guard for the sanctuary, or a spy for the shaman (see animal spy), with certain limitations: Creatures with animal intelligence cannot convey details of a situation effectively. For example, two hundred heavily armored soldiers might be reported as “lots of people, making clanking sounds.” Further, such creatures cannot understand human conversation or recognize social interaction. Nonetheless, these animals can serve as an early warning system for the shaman.\n\nThe animals are not made suicidal or slavishly loyal by this spell, but merely see the shaman as their leader—a rank that may confer responsibilities as well as privileges: A pack of dogs, for example, might expect their pack leader to organize their hunting and the division of the kills, and might desert a leader who fails in these duties.\n\nThe spell's duration is effectively permanent, but the sanctuary is destroyed if the shaman recasts the spell in a second location. Each shaman can have only one sanctuary. The sanctuary also fades upon the caster's death, unless the shaman chooses to inhabit it as a ghost. Any strong supernatural presence might also dispel the sanctuary (such as the entrance of a powerful extraplanar being, or sprinkling the area with copious quantities of holy or unholy water).\n\nTypical spiritualist shaman sanctuaries include sewers and cellars (where hundreds of rats may breed), graveyards (often accompanied by a pack of dogs), or ruined towers (housing bats, crows, or cats).\n\nCasting this spell requires a successful Shamanic Ritual check, as a sacrifice is made as part of the casting (this is the material component). The sacrifice is received by the totem spirit of the animals who are to make up the sanctuary's guardians.

        "Introduction": "An elemental priest of Athas who finds a power conjunction will often begin the magical process of turning it into an elemental shrine. The entire process takes about 3 months and requires a substantial investment of time and energy.\n\nThe first requirement of the spell is to find a natural area where the priest's patron element is strong.\n\nShrines of rain must be in special places where natural rainfall is common. Sun priests may build their shrines on high mountains. Shrines to the lords of fire require more effort. First, the priest must create an eternal flame. Atop this fire, the priest must place an item of great value to himself. When the blaze finally dies to the size of a camp-fire, the priest begins the create shrine spell, and the flame burns forever. The item is sacrificed to the lords of fire and destroyed in the conflagration.\n\nOnce the area has been prepared and any threats removed from it, the priest sits and meditates on the nature of his element. This continues for at least eight hours every day for the next three months. Any time missed negates the spell, and the priest must begin again from scratch.\n\nWhen three months have passed, the shrine grants the caster a number of special, temporary hit points, equal to 12 times the caster's level. These are good only while the priest is actually at the shrine, and can be used only to absorb damage from defiling magic.\n\nAlso, while on the grounds of the shrine, the priest can exercise his ability to ignore the elements an unlimited number of times per day. The power continues if the priest leaves the shrine, but then it expires normally. This counts as a use for that day, so the priest can only exploit this ability again by returning to the shrine.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of priests who can benefit from being at a shrine, and none can be affected by spells of that element while there.\n\nThe priest is under no obligation to remain at\n\nthe shrine after it is created, but many do, insuring its protection.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for elemental priests in the Dark Sun setting: virtually unknown elsewhere."

The purpose of such weapons is to cause damage to spirits on the Prime Material Plane.\n\nThe spell generally only works on spirits with 1 Hit Die. A spirit that does not wish to be bound is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. More powerful spirits can be bound with their own consent, and usually demand assurances that they are to be freed after a certain period of time.\n\nBound spirits retain full use and control of all powers they had before bound (it can attack the knife's creator or wielder if it wishes, even if bound); it is wise to use a compliant or harmless spirit. Many shamans prefer to take only willing spirits for these knives, and may rescue dying spirits from trees ravaged by fire, or streams drying in a drought, for use in these weapons.\n\nAny spirit hit by a spiritknife (normal attack roll, with adjustments for invisibility applied as normal) takes 2d4 points of damage for each Hit Die of the spirit bound within the weapon. Spirits currently possessing objects or people, and spirits in the spirit world, are invulnerable to this damage (although the base damage of the weapon will still be inflicted on the vessel, if appropriate).\n\nSpiritknives must be slashing weapons (usually knives or daggers). The material from which a spiritknife is made cannot have been contaminated, purified or altered, though the maker may change the shape of the material. Thus, metals (extracted from ores) cannot be used, but stone, bone, and wood are acceptable. Most spiritknives are made from flint or wood, though obsidian, marble and other substances are usable.\n\nThe material component for this spell is the weapon itself, which is not destroyed on casting.\n\nNotes: Restricted to shamans, uncommon.",

If the tomb is larger than the spell's area of effect, additional castings can ensure that the entire crypt complex benefits from the spell.

The bones attack as fighters equal to one-third of the caster's level at the time the crypt\n\nward was set up (fractions dropped) and possess 5 hit points per one-third/level of the caster. Thus, a crypt ward cast by a 12th level priest produces 4th level bones that possess 20 hit points each. The bones are not undead creatures; the effect is similar to animated weapons. The dwarven bones do not animate and attack if the intruders are other dwarves, so long as the visitors do not attempt to plunder the tomb. Other races will be attacked if not accompanied by a dwarf.\n\nIn any case, the dwarven bones animated by this spell cannot leave the area of effect. If intruders flee that area, the dwarven bones return to their resting places until the next intrusion. If the animated dwarves are slain, the remains have been destroyed.\n\nDispel magic cannot negate a crypt ward, but a limited wish, wish, or remove crypt ward can. The destruction of all the dwarven bones in the tomb complex also negates the spell.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, remove crypt ward, enables the caster to negate a crypt ward. In most dwarven enclaves, remove crypt ward is reserved for those rare times when dwarven remains must be transported to a new site. A priest attempting to remove the crypt ward must be of equal or greater level than the caster who set the spell in place.\n\nThis spell is available to priests of all dwarven religions, but is typically reserved for the priests of Dumathoin, who are generally regarded as the keepers of the dead. It is said that the dwarven priests of old were far stronger than those of today, so it is likely that, in truly ancient dwarven strongholds. there are crypt wards that cannot be removed by modern priests.\n\nThe material components for both versions of this spell are the casters holy symbol and the ritual sacrifice of 10,000 gp worth of precious metals and minerals.\n\nNotes: Restricted to dwarven priests; typically granted by Dumathoin."

For example, an exaggerated fear of dying (requiring the creature to make a saving throw vs. paralyzation to avoid the effect of a fear spell whenever encountering a cadaver, human bones, a graveyard, or even an open coffin). On the other hand, the victim might become convinced that all corpses were undead, waiting to rip him or her to shreds. In a combat situation, an opponent can be neutralized with an incapacitating form of insanity, such as confusion or feeblemind. The insanity is permanent and cannot be dispelled except by casting cure insanity, heal, restoration, or wish.\n\nNotes: Rare spell. The reverse is common for necromancer-priests, for whom it is 4th level.",
        "Insanity Results": "Roll 1d6 for each affected creature to determine the nature of the affliction.\n\nEnraged Maniac: This condition strikes suddenly (1 in 6 chance per turn, lasts 2d6 turns then 1 in 6 chance per turn to return to normalcy). The character becomes maniacally enraged, having an effective Strength of 18/75 if human or demihuman (nonhumans are adjudicated by the DM). The character may shriek, rave, and behave in a violent manner. Unreasoning when spoken to, the character possesses great cunning and will desire to take or avoid action according to the situation at hand (though not necessarily on appropriate act). When the state passes the individual won't remember his actions, nor believe accounts of them by others.\n\nMelancholic: The individual is given to black fits of brooding and feelings of hopelessness. The character is 50% likely to ignore any given situation due to the manifestation of a fit of melancholia.\n\nHallucinating: The individual sees, hears, and otherwise senses things that do not exist. The more stressful the situation, the more likely the manifestation. Common delusions include: ordinary objects that do not exist, people nearby or passing where there are none, voices giving information or instructions, abilities or forms the individual does not really have (Strength, sex, wings etc.), threatening creatures appearing from nowhere, and so on. Normal behavior is 50% likely until stimulated or under stress. Hallucinations last 1-20 turns after the initial stress passes.\n\nHebephrenic: The individual wanders aimlessly, talks to himself, giggles, mutters, and acts childishly; the character may sometimes attempt to play childish games with others. If sufficiently irritated by someone nearby, the character is 75% likely to become maniacally enraged. If this does not occur, then he will become catatonic for 1d6 hours then revert to hebephrenic behavior.\n\nHomicidal: The individual appears absolutely normal, except for an occasional unique interest in weapons, poisons, and other lethal devices. At 1- to 4-day intervals, the being will try to kill a member of his own race. If prevented, the frustrated individual will attack the first intelligent creature seen, wildly seeking to slay. After this, the character will fall into melancholy for 1d6 days before turning to a homicidal state once more.\n\nCatatonic: The character completely withdraws from reality. The individual can be led, moved, fed, and so on; but undertakes no activity on his own. If continually provoked and irritated to get a response, the character has a 1 To cumulative chance per round of becoming homicidal. When provocation ceases catatonia returns."

It then returns to infancy over the period of a turn, growing younger slowly at first and then rapidly until it is once again an infant of its species. No system shock survival roll is required. The infant has no memory of its previous life. Commonly, a halfling community or the priest then raises the infant to respect halflings and the ways of Yondalla. An infant of a species inherently unsafe to raise (say, a troll or a dragon), it is placed with a foster parent of a species able to properly raise it in a positive moral and ethical fashion.\n\nAn undead creature of less than divine status that fails its saving throw is destroyed by this spell, but a creature of extraplanar origin is merely cast back to its home plane and unable to return to the Prime Material Plane for 10d10 years. A creature with magic resistance has it reduced by a -25% penalty against the effects of a curse of Yondalla. A creature that successfully saves still suffers 3d8+3 points of damage or half its remaining hit points in damage, whichever is less.\n\nThe bestowed curse of Yondalla cannot be dispelled, though it can be removed by a remove curse cast by the same priest of Yondalla who cast it or by any good priest whose level exceeds the original caster's level; it can also be negated by a full wish. When the curse is removed, the creature returns to its normal age over the course of 1 turn (requiring no system shock survival roll). It remembers events that took place during its second youth in addition to those of its previous older life. Destroyed undead creatures can be restored or extraplanar creatures can be allowed to return before the end of the allotted time only by a full wish or divine intervention.\n\nPriests of Yondalla do not cast this spell lightly. Yondalla's divine servitors or Yondalla herself are said to watch over its use and prevent it from being successfully cast if they feel its use is an abuse of the divine privilege.\n\nThe material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol."

For example, cause light wounds and hold person can delivered by a dark embrace spell, but a flame strike cannot.\n\nUpon the utterance of the command word, the black half-mask dissolves once again into a dark shadow that then moves to envelop the intended target.

        "Introduction": "This spell serves as an unerring direction finder underground or in darkness, to an item, chosen during the casting, which the caster has handled before. Once during the course of the spell, if the direction to the object lies through a wall, including the natural rock of a cavern, the caster can touch the wall and create as passage much like the 5th level wizard spell, passwall.\n\nThe object sought must be a specific, portable item, well known to the caster, typically a spare holy symbol, undergarment, memento, or even a nondescript stone that the priest keeps hidden in his abode. The spell points to it even if the item has moved for any reason, and thus a priest can be deceived when using this spell to learn directions. Conversely, when the item is being carried on a known journey, the priest can use multiple dark road spells to trace the progress of the carrier.\n\nA dark mad spell operates correctly even when miles underground, in areas of strong natural or magical radiations, and through most known magical barriers.\n\nThe passage power creates a temporary opening four feet wide, six feet high, and 20 feet deep, through solid stone, earth and rocks, mud, sand, wood, plaster, metal, and even magical barriers created by spells of 6th level or less. The tunnel can slope and curve, changing its grade or shifting one foot for each foot of its run. (Up or down and left or right, but never changing its direction to zigzag, or to rise and then fall. Only one change in gradient or shift in direction from the straight is possible.) The passage lasts for one round per level of the caster, and cannot be ended at will. It can be traversed by any being or thrown item regardless of the caster's will, and can be combined with other dark mad spells to create a longer passage. When it closes, the passage expels items and beings within it; there is no known way to entomb a creature or object by closing a dark mad tunnel upon it. Dark mad tunnels are unaffected by dispel\n\nitem sought, and a preserved eye (or tears from the eye) of any burrowing or earth-phasing creature, from a mole to a xorn.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Shar, Mistress of the Night, evil goddess of the Forgotten Realms setting. This spell is found only in a few exceptionally rare tomes."

        "Introduction": "This spell instantly brings into being a ribbon like, weightless but unbreakable black bridge. The matte black strip of force is straight, 2 feet wide, an inch thick, has no side rails, and can be as long as 20 feet per caster's level. Its length may be only inches, or it may stretch to the maximum allowed by the spell range but the dark way must be created so that both ends are anchored to stationary, stable, solid objects such as roofs, walls, or cliff faces, not dirt slopes or tree branches. It cannot bend, but can climb or dip if the caster desires.\n\nA dark way spell need not span a chasm, but can be created inches above the floor of a room (running from wall to wall) to allow its caster to take advantage of its other properties.\n\nOnce created, the dark way is immobile, and withstands all known spells and attacks. It cannot be destroyed (even by will of the caster) before the spell ends. It can be traversed by all creatures and does not conduct electricity, heat, or magical effects. The caster cannot fall from or be struck or swept from the dark way (though he can deliberately jump), and while in contact with any part of the way, can lift, carry, and wield any weight (of beings, items, or both) as if they weighed nothing.\n\nThis allows a caster to stand on the way in defiance of gale-force winds or even elude attacks by walking on the edges or bottom of its span. The “weightless” property of the span has been used by some priests to dupe others into thinking that the caster possesses mighty strength (lifting a horse, for instance, while standing on a dark way hidden behind an altar).\n\nThis property does not apply to other creatures. Any being who overloads the way (stepping onto it with a total burdened weight half again as much as the caster's burdened body weight at the time of casting) falls through the dark way, even though it remains solid to all other creatures. In other words, if the caster of dark way plus what the caster is wearing and carrying weighs 100 pounds, and he flees along the span, a pursuing monster who weighs 150 pounds or more plunges through it. Obviously, creatures other than the caster can fall from the way, as they could from any narrow bridge.\n\nThe material components of a dark way spell are one of the caster's hairs, some spider web, and a shard of black glass (man-made or obsidian).\n\nNotes: Granted by the god Mask of the Forgotten Realms setting.

A blow from a flaming hand inflicts 1d8 points of fire-based damage.\n\nDarkfire from the hand can be willed into handfuls and thrown. One ball of flame can be hurled up to 10 feet, as if the caster was attacking directly. Thrown darkfire inflicts 1d3 points of damage plus 1 additional point per caster level, to a maximum of 1d3+10 points of damage at 10th level. The DM should use the grenadelike missile table to determine where misses land – such misses have the usual incendiary effect and the darkfire itself rages for 1d2 rounds before burning out.\n\nThis magic was developed for use in rituals of worship to Lolth, but has since been adapted into an offensive battle spell.

If the flame jets from the caster's eyes, it has a range of 15 feet. A successful attack roll is required to inflict damage, which is only half as much as a successful touch (round up).\n\nAn undead is restored by darkfire and regains lost hit points equal to the damage the spell inflicts upon living things. This spell can also knit together severed undead body parts, restoring them to a functioning whole. The parts must be brought into contact and properly assembled before the darkfire is applied, and the spell must manifest across the breakage.

While it is unaffected by spells governing undead or dragons, a dispel magic spell causes it to melt away instantly. It flies about at MV Fl 12 (D) and is able to attack twice per round. Regardless of what body part appears to attack, these are always THAC0 10 bludgeoning blows that inflict 1d12 points of damage each.\n\nA death dragon isn't truly solid, and therefore can't be ridden by its caster or struck by opponents – their blows pass through apparent nothingness.\n\nThe material components of a death dragon spell are four bones, all of which must be complete and intact. One of these remnants must be from a reptile and one from an avian. Alternatively, a single fragment or whole bone from any sort of dragon will serve.\n\nNotes: Granted by the god Kelemvor, Judge of the Damned, of the Forgotten Realms setting. This spell is found only in a few exceptionally rare tomes.\n\nDM Option: The DM might rule that exceptionally large and powerful creatures (at least 8+3 Hit Dice) might disperse the death dragon in melee combat if the caster fails a saving throw vs. spell (check each round of melee in which the creature attacks only the death dragon). Exceptional attacks, such as a breath weapon inflicting more than 50 points of damage, might also disperse this spell instantly."

The saving throw cannot be better than 6 or more on 1 d20 in any event (75%), even if magically augmented. Failure means the corpse will rise as the appropriate type of undead. Success means that the corpse is merely dead. This prevents the corpse from returning, for example, as a ghoul, ghast, wight, wraith, specter, or even a vampire.\n\nWhile the corpse is sealed, a speak with dead spell or its equivalent cannot contact the spirit unless the caster is of higher level than the caster of the death prayer.

The being can cast spells without breaking this protection, and conduct any mental activity desired (including the use of psionics or telepathy) behind the mental screen. A deceive prying spell provides no protection against enchantment/charm spells or psionic attacks except to give a +1 bonus to the initial saving throw against a charm person magic (not the more powerful charm monster), by making the attacker's mind assault less precise. Priests of Vhaeraun use this spell to hide from those trying to discover their identities.\n\nThe material components are a drop of cranial fluid and a small cube of iron.\n\nNotes: Granted by the drow god Vhaeraun."

The primary use of this spell is to detect underground hazardous natural gases such as explosive methane or poisonous sulphur, or toxic gases like carbon monoxide, but this spell can also detect any other harmful gas that occurs naturally or is produced by alchemy or magic.\n\nIn addition to revealing the presence of such gases, the caster has a 5% chance per level to identify the specific type of gas found (for example, chlorine gas, methane, or carbon monoxide), to a maximum chance of 75%. Some rare, exotic gases might be beyond a priest's ability to identify exactly, although the identification roll may indicate the possible danger from or effect of the gas.\n\nThe material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell, known to dwarven priests.

It does not reveal the exact alignment or nature of anything in the area of effect, only the general proportions of each element. The DM must consult his information about the target area to determine the answer. Answers are always vague – “there is more evil than good here! or “the lawful order of the universe is ascendant in this area.”\n\nWhen cast upon a living creature, the spell takes into account not only the creature's given alignment, but also the acts they have done, the actions they currently intend to do, and any other factors that may be at variance with their stated alignment. Thus, a lawful evil character noted for his occasional outbursts of compassion towards the helpless would be detected as being “faithful but in which the other forces are at struggle.” Also. the spell can be cast on buildings and areas in an attempt to learn whether there are powers at work in these places. A dwelling haunted by spirits would show the harmonies tending towards evil and destruction, while the cave of a noted holy hermit would give the opposite impression. The material component for this spell is a specially prepared scroll of sutras costing 5 chi'en (25 gp) for the paper and inks.\n\nNotes: Common for priests from an oriental setting; otherwise, very rare."

The spell's range is diminished if more than a one-inch thickness of wood or stone lies between the priest and the subject. Each inch of thickness of a wood or stone barrier is treated as 10 feet of open space. A barrier of metal of any thickness causes the spell to fail and be ruined. Any form of mental protection, including those of psionic or magical nature, likewise ruins the spell without anything being detected. The spell detects the first living creature that lies along the priest's line of sight (and within range), or else the first creature that crosses the line-of-sight path before the duration expires.\n\nNotes: Common for priests of an oriental setting.

The detect powers spell also reveals if the caster's patron is worshipped in that sphere.\n\nIf the sphere is one known to the DM, or one which has its major powers already designed, then the spell reveals if the priest's deity, or deities related to the one involved (either members of the same pantheon or with similar attributes and portfolio) exist. For example, while two war gods of different campaigns settings may be sufficiently similar to justify “related” status, a god of smithing may have no parallel in a world without developed metalcraft. In that situation, a priest devoted to the smithing god would not find a power to recharge his spells.\n\nIf the sphere is new to the DM (that is, the adventurers just discovered it), and he or she has no clear idea what lies within, then roll on the table for a possible response to the spell.\n\nWhile many powers have similar portfolios and areas of interest (war, healing, agriculture, death and so on), they are often at varying alignments. In one fantasy world, a war god might be a good and lawful figure. On another world, a war deity may be evil and chaotic.\n\nA priest is able to tell the alignment of the power closest to his deity through the detect powers spell. Accepting spells from a power of similar portfolio but opposite alignment is dangerous, and any priest who does so must regain favor with his chief deity (through quest or atonement) before further advancement in his class is possible.\n\nA number of specialty faiths exist only in space fantasy campaigns, including the Polygots, The Path & the Way, Ptah, and the Planar Churches. If a space-going civilization of any sort exists in the crystal sphere, then these faiths will be represented somewhere in that system.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a handful of sand, which the priest casts onto the crystal shell.\n\nNotes: Common for priests from a spelljamming culture; otherwise, very rare."

The spell would not normally detect a single elf or half-elf who moved through the area recently unless the individual did something dramatic while there (killed someone, cast a powerful spell, built a house, etc.).\n\nThe caster does not learn the nature of the elves' activity in the area in question. He knows only that elves have been or are currently present. The sensation can vary in strength depending on the activity (it may be especially strong, for example, if a large battle had been fought there).\n\nThe priest can probe multiple areas within the spell duration. Successfully probing an area takes a minimum of one round. Thus, a 1st level priest can probe as many as 11 areas if working quickly.\n\nWhen humans first battled elves in the forests of Cerilia, many of the gods granted human priests the ability to detect elven influence wherever they went. Since the Battle of Mount Deismaar and the destruction of the old gods, this spell has helped many tribes of humans steer clear of elven territory or attack it in response to the ghealle sidhe.\n\nThe spell requires an elven object.\n\nNotes: Common for priests from Cerilia, the Birthright setting."

This can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. Unlike the augury spell, this gives a specific piece of advice. For example, if the question is “Will we do well if we venture to the third/level?” and a terrible troll guarding 10,000 gp and a shield +1 lurks near the entrance to the level (the DM estimates the party could beat the troll after a hard fight) the divination response might be: “Ready oil and open flame light your way to wealth.” In all cases, the DM controls what information is received and whether additional divinations will supply additional information. Note that if the information is not acted upon, the conditions probably change so that the information is no longer useful (in the example, the troll might move away and take the treasure with it).\n\nThe base chance for a correct divination is 60%, plus 1% for each experience level of the priest casting the spell. The DM makes adjustments to this base chance considering the actions being divined (if, for example, unusual precautions against the spell have been taken). If the dice roll is failed, the caster knows the spell failed. unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.\n\nThe material components of the divination spell are a sacrificial offering, incense, and the holy symbol of the priest. If an unusually important divination is attempted, sacrifice of particularly valuable gems, jewelry, or magical items may be required.\n\nNotes: Common for clerics and druids (PHB)."

        "Introduction": "This spell creates a terrible and lasting curse, so it can be cast only upon someone who has performed a great evil – at least in the eyes of the caster. The awful deed may even have been unintentional, but it must have yielded horrible results for the caster. The victim of the curse can be of any alignment. The caster personally chooses the punishment. Wording is very important, so the player must record the exact phrasing for future reference. The curse may fail if the punishment is inappropriate, too harsh, or otherwise lacking (at the DM's discretion). In this case, the DM can choose to either guide the player to a curse that is acceptable or make the character wait to\n\nsee if the curse takes effect.\n\nThe priest becomes a vessel for the divine wrath he invokes. He must clearly announce the curse in the presence of the evildoer. Thereafter, the curse is in effect, though its effects sometimes take time to surface. Instead, the curse may develop over months or years. Divine curse can be lifted. The victim has two means of removing the\n\ncurse. An atonement spell can lift the curse, provided the spell accompanies a great, heroic deed or similar act of expiation. Such an action must be an appropriate counter to the original evil deed.\n\nSometimes, the curse itself may include an escape clause. Often the clue to lifting the curse is hidden somewhere within the wording. The DM should encourage such clauses, since they do not necessarily provide an easy escape, as illustrated by this sample curse:\n\nYou have walked long upon the backs of the downtrodden. Now, each step you take shall be a painful blow to your flesh, until you stride barefoot to the summit of Mount Arabek between sunrise and sunset\n\nAt first the escape clause seems deadly, if not impossible, to fulfill, but a creative DM or player should be able to circumvent the obvious. For instance, the cursed individual might pay someone to cast a haste spell upon him or otherwise increase his rate of travel.\n\nCurses inflicted with evil intent may trigger a Ravenloft powers check.\n\nThe material components for this spell are a tiny silver gong and the priest's holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Common for priests on the Demiplane of Dread."

The chance of seeing a random event instead is 100%, minus 5% per caster level.\n\nThe spell provides a vision of a single event and sufficient clues to interpret its details, possibly allowing the identification of the participants and the reconstruction of the sequence of events. When the caster receives sufficient impressions (in the form of figures and depictions) to allow interpretation of the event, usually one to three rounds, the spell ends.\n\nDivine Past: This allows the caster to divine a past event from 1 hour to 1 year old, depending on the caster's level. A caster of 7th or 8th level can divine the past up to one week. A caster of 9th to 13th level can see events up a month old. Casters of higher level can see events of up to a year old.\n\nDivine Present: This allows the caster to divine an event from the present or the immediate past (1 round to 4 turns). A caster of 7th or 8th level can divine up to one turn. A caster of 9th to 13th level can divine events up to two turns old. Casters of higher level can see events up to four turns old. This casting might fail against magics that prevent scrying. The base chance of success is 50%, plus 5% for each level the caster is greater than the caster of the protection (and -5% per level the caster is less than the caster of the protection).\n\nDivine Future: This allows the caster to divine an event that will happen in the next 1 turn to 1 day. A caster of 7th or 8th level can divine up to one turn. A caster of 9th to 13th level can divine events up to one hour in the future. Casters of higher level can see events up to one day in the future. Such a future is generally one of several possible futures, and might be changed with precautions based on foreknowledge.\n\nThe material component for all versions is a rare incense conducive to meditation (100 gp).\n\nNotes: Granted by gods of divination, otherwise very rare.

Neither the item nor holy symbol is altered by the spell. Through divine guidance, the caster can glimpse a vision of what the mystery item once was a part of, or how it is used or functions. Whether or not the spell succeeds, it drains 1 hit point from the caster (which can be regained readily through rest or magical healing).\n\nThe chance of learning something about an item has a base of 1%per level of the caster, plus 1% per point of the caster's Wisdom, plus 5% if the item was made by beings of the same race as the caster, plus 10% if the item is or was wholly nonmagical in its functioning (not necessarily in its making), plus 10% if the item performs a function or has an end effect similar to one personally familiar to the caster. (For example: If the caster has shoed horses, an unfamiliar smithy tool concerned with horseshoes would gain this modifier.)\n\nThe DM must determine how clear or extensive is the vision gained. This spell is very good at showing the nearby location (if such exists) where an item was used or allied items lie, but it is very poor at showing the identities of past users of an item. A priest can only work divine purpose on a given item once: subsequent castings fail.\n\nThe material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Granted by the god Gond, Lord of All Smiths, of the Forgotten Realms setting.

Flying creatures are blown backwards 50–100 feet. Reinforced buildings and stone buildings are relatively undamaged, generally suffering 1d4 points of structural damage. Boats on shore are cast about like matchsticks. Seas become raging tempests, deserts are shrouded in massive dust storms, and snowy regions are blinded by blizzards. Small fires blow out while large fires (the size of a building or more) erupt into raging conflagrations. Crops are 75% ruined.\n\nCreatures caught within the area of the divine wind suffer 1d10 points of damage for each full turn they are exposed to the weather. Creatures are reasonably safe within shelters, but they can be buried in sand or snow or swamped by crashing waves. When moving through the area affected by the spell, all movement rates are reduced to 1/4 normal.

        "Introduction": "This spell creates a black, creeping mist filling a maximum area of eight 10-foot by 10-foot cubes. It forms directly in front of the caster, who can choose to make it stationary or direct it to move away at a rate of 3 yards per round; once this choice is made, it cannot be altered. A doomtide is destroyed by a successful dispel magic spell, a magical gust of wind, or any magic that affects vapors; it is unaffected by natural winds (even if extremely violent).\n\nA doomtide has no effect on the caster and (if the caster desires) one other being who touches the caster during the casting – all others who enter it see hundreds of long, slender black tentacles coiling and reaching for them.\n\nThese menaces are illusory, but the mists do have some real effects: All missile and other aimed attacks (including spells) are at -4 on attack rolls due to the visual confusion, all creatures within suffer a -4 initiative penalty, and beings of less than 7th level or 7 Hit Dice must make a saving throw vs. spell for each round in which they are in contact with a doomtide or do nothing for that round (seemingly dazed and unaware of their surroundings). To the caster and the other lone protected being, the doomtide appears as a faint coloration in the air, and it offers no obstacle to vision.\n\nThe material components of a doomtide spell are a pinch of soot from any fire, a piece of eel skin (or an eel, which can be alive or dead, whole or partial), and a piece of string, thread, or cord (anything flexible and organic serves) tied into at least three knots.\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil goddess Beshaba, Maid of Misfortune, of the Forgotten Realms setting. This spell is found only in a few exceptionally rare tomes."

        "Introduction": "When using this spell, the shukenja falls into a deep sleep and dreams of nearby places and events. The caster's spirit is projected to the location within range desired. Places and events seen in the dreams happening at the time of the dreaming, these are not past or future events. In the dream, the caster can both see and hear and can will his or her spirit to move about normally.\n\nThe dream spirit can pass through solid objects with no difficulty, but cannot enter any area guarded by a protection spell (whether good, neutral, or evil), nor can sounds coming from such an area be heard. The shukenja's spirit can either move at a rate of 36 or observe the scene during one round. Thus, a 3rd level shukenja could send her dream spirit up to 720 feet in the first two rounds and then spend the third (and last) round observing the desired scene.\n\nAt the end of the spell, the dream spirit of the shukenja automatically returns to the body. The shukenja can also voluntarily return before the end of the spell. If the shukenja's body is disturbed before the dream spirit returns, the shukenja must make a saving throw vs. death. If the save is successful, the dream spirit returns safely to the body with no ill effect. If the saving throw is unsuccessful, the body falls into a deep catatonic state and the dream spirit is unable to return of its own accord. Another shukenja can use dream sleep to guide the lost dream spirit back to its body, if able to locate it.\n\nFurthermore, while in dream sleep, the spirit of the shukenja is considered a lesser spirit for the purposes of all spells. Thus, it can be forced to answer questions by a commune with lesser spirit spell, cannot see things hidden by an invisibility to spirits spell, and can be destroyed by a smite spell. If the dream spirit is destroyed, the shukenja's body falls into a catatonic state that can be lifted only by a raise dead, resurrection, limited wish, or wish spell.\n\nThe material component for this spell is a stick of incense worth at least one chain (5 gp).\n\nNotes: Common for priests from an oriental setting; otherwise, very rare."

        "Introduction": "By means of this spell, the shukenja is able to send messages to others in the form of dreams. At the beginning of the casting, the shukenja names whom the message is for. The shukenja must know the identity of the recipient or identify him by some title that leaves no question as to the recipient. For example, the shukenja could send a dream to the governor of Changtai Province, even if he has never met the man, since there is only one governor of that province. However, he could not send a dream to the sake-maker of a village in that province, since there might be several sake-makers in that village.\n\nUpon completing the physical casting of the spell, which requires but a turn, the shukenja falls into a deep, trancelike sleep. At this point his spirit leaves his body and travels instantaneously to the recipient Thereupon, the shukenja is able to enter the dreams of the recipient and deliver his message unless the recipient is magically protected from spirits. If the recipient is awake when the spell is cast, the shukenja can choose to regain in his trancelike sleep until the recipient goes to sleep or he can choose to cancel the spell. The shukenja does not learn anything about the current activities or whereabouts of the recipient, only whether he is asleep or awoke.\n\nOnce the shukenja enters the dreams of the recipient, he can deliver a message of any length desired, which the recipient remembers perfectly upon awakening. The communication is one way – the recipient cannot offer information or ask questions of the shukenja. Neither can the shukenja gain any information by observing the\n\ndreams of the recipient. Once the message is delivered, the shukenja's spirit returns instantly to his body. If the body is disturbed in any way while using this spell, the shukenja's spirit becomes lost. The body remains in its comatose state until some means is found to rejoin the shukenja's spirit with his body, such as a restore spirit spell.\n\nThe duration of this spell is the amount of time required for the shukenja to enter into the dreams of the other and then deliver the message. Thus, the duration could be as short as one round or as long as several hours.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, nightmare, allows the shukenja to send a hideous and unsettling vision to the subject. The identity of the subject must be known, as stated above, and the subject must be asleep. This nightmare prevents restful sleep and causes the victim to lose 1d10 hit points. Since the individual has not rested, he is fatigued as if he had not had the night's sleep and is unable to regain spells. The subject is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effects of the nightmare.\n\nThe material components for this spell are a bowl of incense and a robe of red (or white for the reverse) silk cloth.\n\nNotes: Common for priests from an oriental setting; otherwise, very rare."

        "Introduction": "This divination reveals things about a touched item in an unfolding process that continues until all information about the item has been gained or the spell duration expires. If the same caster employs another dweomer divination on an item already examined by use of this spell, the magic reveals new information. A dweomer divination ends immediately if the caster neglects to touch or handle the item for an entire round or if the item is found to bear no dweomer.\n\nIn the first round of a dweomer divination, all dweomers present on the item or linked to it are revealed; on the second round, any alignment or class restrictions or special benefits associated with the item are identified; in the third round, the primary function or most powerful dweomer on the item is fully revealed – in other words, how it works – to the dweomer divination caster; during the fourth round any word of activation or command process associated with that primary power is revealed; and on the fifth round, anything wrong with, or missing from, the functioning of that power is clearly and fully identified. These successive rounds of inquiry occur even if there are no words or magical problems associated with the power, and at the end of each round, the caster is made positively aware of such absences.\n\nOn subsequent rounds, this process is repeated for any additional item powers or properties after the primary or most powerful one in descending order of intensity of their dweomer or importance of their effect until all item powers have been explored. (In other words, the cycle of rounds three through five repeats as necessary.) The spell then turns to revealing any additional control words or operating restrictions on the item for a round (such as special purposes or personal linkages), recharging methods or the confirmed absence of same on the next round, and some images of how the item was made on subsequent rounds.\n\nInformation gained after the first round occurs only for items that have been enchanted, not normal tools, furniture, or garments. Upon normal items, dweomer divination essentially performs as a very sophisticated, but ultimately little more informative, detect magic.\n\nNote that a powerful spell that touches an item – a fireball blast that flings a weapon down a hall, for example – leaves a trace dweomer on the item for 1 day per level of the spell, so that non-enchanted items can still bear trace dweomers. Magics meant to be permanent or long-lasting and spells that wait quiescent indefinitely for specific trigger conditions to occur leave dweomers of much longer duration – months or years per spell level – on items in contact with them. The spell reveals the approximate nature of such associate dweomers, but not what their precise damage, extent, or trigger conditions were or are.\n\nA dweomer divination provides no protection against curses or magical traps placed on items other than to identify them in its unfolding process. It does not delay or prevent such traps' or curses' normal functioning in anyway. Dweomer divination might not reveal side effects that the item's enchanter did not intend or foresee.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell from the Forgotten Realms setting."

        "Introduction": "This spell can be cast in one of two fashions. In the first version, dweomerflow is cast on a spell-caster. It causes the next spell cast by that individual to flow into a prepared receptacle the caster touches instead of taking its usual effect. No saving throw is required of the spellcaster or the receptacle. Typical receptacles include a focal stone, a crystal ball, or another item that can hold magics within itself, such as magical items in need of recharging, crucibles temporarily empowered by spells to accept enchantments, artifacts, and the like. If the item is destroyed or later affected by spells that force it to disgorge stored magics, the “flowed” spell is released, often taking its full effect.\n\nDweomerflow creates a resonating field between the subject spellcaster and the receptacle. If no suitable item is in range, the dweomerflow creates a ghostly swirling radiance that lasts one round, then fades away. If no other receptacle becomes available within that time, the spell is wasted.\n\nA holy water font or consecrated altar can accept up to a dozen flowed spells to be released separately, one per round, at any time thereafter by any being of the faith the holy object is consecrated to who touches the altar and wills the magics forth. The subjects, aims, and areas of effect of such magics are under the silent mental control of the being unleashing them, who need not be the caster of the dweomerflow or even of a class or level necessary to normally wield such magics. Any individual who is not aware of what magics are stored in a holy font or altar requires 1 round of contact with the holy object per stored spell to identify and gain control over such magics. One randomly chosen magic at a time is revealed – but only to beings of the same faith as the holy object or to wizards and priests employing dweomer divination or similar powerful magics.\n\nSpells of 5th level or greater must be accompanied by an abeyance spell cast on the altar or spell vessel within 1 turn of their being flowed into it – or they erupt back out at again, visiting their full effects, at a random time and at a random target or area of effect. (Previous abeyance spells cast into the same altar or vessel do not suffice to govern a newly arrived flowed magic.)\n\nMost temple and shrine altars are imbued with powerful offensive spells by high-ranking clergy of the faith for lesser priests to use in defending the holy ground against intruders. Those planning to despoil an altar are warned that breakage of a holy object; its exposure to fire, lightning, or the touch of unholy water; or cold iron used to chisel away holy symbols or inscriptions almost always awakens stored magics – to take effect right where the cause of their activation occurs!\n\nThe second version of dweomerflow allows the spellcaster to transfer charges or stored spells from item to item, such as a charge from one wand of lightning to another or a spell from one ring of spell storing to another. When this version of dweomerflow is cast, a saving throw vs. spell must be made by both items involved. If the sending item fails its saving throw, the dweomerflow spell is ruined, but no charges or stored spells are lost. If the receiving spell fails its saving throw, the charge or spell being transferred is lost – sometimes with spectacular effects – along with the dweomerflow. In this version of the spell, the spellcaster must be touching both items involved to provide a bridge for the spell energy involved.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell from the Forgotten Realms setting."

This spell can be used to monitor all the earth and stone in a spherical volume with a radius of 30 feet per level of the caster. The priest can note anything unusual or important happening within the area of effect through a vague feeling of unease or impending danger. Once the feeling is experienced, the priest can try to concentrate on determining the specific thing that has set off the feeling of alarm. The chance of identifying the specific event is 5% per level of the caster. Only one identification roll can be made for each event that may trigger the feeling. If the roll fails, the priest is unable to determine the exact problem, but does identify the general area where the problem is occurring.\n\nOnce the spell is cast, the dwarven priest must remain quietly in place to continue concentrating on the spell. If the priest moves more than 10 feet from the spot where the spell was cast or engages in strenuous activity such as melee, the spell is broken.\n\nMany different things can set off the feeling of alarm. Digging or sapping in the area, movements by burrowing creatures, spells or magic that currently affect the earth, non-silent movement across the earth or through a nearby passage, strenuous physical activity (such as melee) occurring on a section of the earth, or an impending natural disaster are all things that can trigger the sense of alarm. A natural disaster that sets off the alarm could be unstable geological conditions that foreshadow a mine collapse or natural earthquake, a natural gas pocket about to explode, or volcanic or geyser activity that could become dangerous.\n\nDwarven priests often maintain a line of sentries in a stronghold and use this spell to monitor anything that may signal an impending attack. Priests might note a section of castle wall being undermined, an attempt to batter through a castle gate, invaders scaling a fortress wall, or a passwall spell suddenly cast upon a section of stone wall. The material components for this spell are the priest's holy symbol and a small sample of earth or stone from the area to be monitored.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell. (Updated from Dragon Magazine.)"

Creatures standing next to the maw surfer no Armor Class penalty.\n\nA successful hit inflicts 1d4 points of damage per level of the caster. An unmodified roll of 19 or 20 means the maw has swallowed the creature whole, burying the individual 2d4 feet below ground. Creatures can be dug out manually, with appropriate spells (such as dig), or with magical items (such as a spade of colossal excavation). A creature trapped underground suffocates unless freed within a number of rounds equal to one-third its Constitution score.\n\nEarthmaw can be cast on any area of loose or packed earth, sand, or vegetation-covered soil. It can be cast indoors on an earthen surface: for example, on the dirt floor of a bam or basement, but not on the marble floor of a home or temple. It cannot be cast on an area containing a tree, any portion of a building, or any type of pavement.\n\nAn object present on the site of the maw (such as a campfire or a tent, etc.) counts as a creature of that object's size in attacks.\n\nThe material component is a tooth from any predatory creature.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for druids."

The arms attack with the same chance to hit as the priest casting the spell, inflicting 1d10+2 points of corrosive and constriction damage.

(If the chance to open doors is unknown, assume that smaller than man-sized creatures escape on the roll of a 1 on 1d6, man-sized creatures on a roll of 1 or 2 on 1d6, and larger than man-sized creatures on a I, 2, or 3 on 1d6).\n\nThe round after scoring a hit, an arm retracts into the central lump, dragging the creature in its grasp against the center and forcing a saving throw vs. death. Thereafter, the creature is held fast, and continues to suffer corrosion and constriction damage, but continued contact with the lump does not require additional saves vs. death. Broken arms retract into the central lump without making further attacks. Arms holding dead creatures continue to hold them until the spell duration expires.\n\nThe material components for this spell are Nerull's unholy symbol (the skull and scythe) and a small, rusty iron ball.\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil god Nerull of the World of Greyhawk setting."

        "Introduction": "This insidious spell accelerates the molting that dragons undergo. It is effective only against dragons, dracohydra, dragon turtles, dragonets and the various draconic hybrids. Ecdysis is not effective against dracoliches and similar undead creatures.\n\nIf the creature makes a successful saving throw vs. spell, then the ecdysis spell has no effect. Failure means the creature begins to rapidly molt. The creature sheds 10% of its scales immediately. By the end of one turn, another 10% are shed, and again after an additional turn passes, another 10% are shed. For each 10% of its scales shed, the target creature suffers a -1 penalty to its Armor Class (thus, after 21 rounds, the creature suffers a -3 penalty to its Armor Class). Scales shed in this manner rapidly decay to dust and are useless as material components for spells.\n\nThe degenerative effects of the spell can be halted, but not reversed, by means of a successful dispel magic, remove curse, or cure disease spell. Only a heal, limited wish, or wish spell can speed recovery from an ecdysis spell. Otherwise, new scales grow naturally at a rate of 10% per tenday. Thus, it takes a full 30 days before a victim of this spell regains its full Armor Class.\n\nThe material components are the priest's holy symbol and a reptilian scale of any type.\n\nNotes: Restricted to dragons. Granted by Null, the Death Wyrm, of the Forgotten Realms setting. This spell is known to exist as a dragon innate spell-like ability."

This roll is further modified by the difference between the original summoner's Wisdom and the caster's: the difference between the two is a bonus added to whomever has the greater Wisdom.\n\nOnly one attempt can be made per creature; if the priest does not seize control of the elemental, no future efforts will succeed. If the effort is successful. the elemental obeys the wishes of the priest for the remainder of its stay on the physical plane.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell. (Updated from Dragon Magazine.)"

        "Introduction": "This spell transports two living creatures (one of whom may be the caster), or a creature and an item, or two items, to “elsewhere” from the place of casting. Travel is safe (akin to a wizard's teleport without error spell), but must be to a destination on the same plane as the caster. If the caster desires, only one being or item can be moved by the spell, but if two are moved, they must go to different destinations. A being can take worn or carried gear, but no more than 400 pounds total weight. An item can be a single thing, a container holding many objects, or any number of articles lashed together, but weighing not more than 400 pounds total. Nonliving material (chosen randomly) in excess of the weight limits is left behind, but a living being who exceeds the weight limit causes the spell to fail. This spell leaves behind parasites, rodents, and hidden creatures riding on a spell recipient, rather than failing because of their presence.\n\nIf a priest casting an “elsewhere chant” takes a single round to unleash it, both affected beings or items are translocated to visible nearby destinations. This use of the spell often serves to put distance between the caster and a foe. If the caster chants for two rounds when casting this spell, the travel of one or both recipients can be to any location on the same plane (that is, distant, out-of-view spots). Destinations must be to places the caster can currently see or has been in at a previous time, not merely the other side of a mountain or an unknown name on a map.\n\nIf a prohibited destination is chosen or some part of a recipient exceeds the limits of the magic, a random destination or part of the recipient to be excluded is determined (such things are never determined by the caster).\n\nNotes: Granted by the god Milil, Lord of All Songs, of the Forgotten Realms setting. This spell is found only in a few exceptionally rare tomes."

If the phylactery is to be destroyed upon opening, the second spell can be fire- or electricity-based. If the phylactery is meant to survive, neither of those attack forms should be employed.\n\nThe phylactery can be previously enchanted. If it is attuned to a being, however (the phylactery of a lich, for example, is specific to that one lich), the second spell does not take effect if that being opens the phylactery, nor will the spell take effect if the caster opens the phylactery.\n\nThe second spell must be cast by the same priest who cast the enchant phylactery spell, and this must be done in the immediately following round. The level at which the second spell takes effect is the same as that of the priest at the time the phylactery was enchanted. Thus, if the second spell was cast by a 9th level priest, the spell takes effect as if cast by a 9th level priest, regardless of how long it has been since the phylactery was enchanted. The second spell requires its usual material components, but if it needs a visible target or operates by touch, the phylactery itself serves that purpose. Only one spell can be placed on a given phylactery with the enchant phylactery spell. A subsequent casting of enchant phylactery replaces a previous casting.\n\nThe material components are a strand of spider-web and an eyelash and sliver of fingernail from the caster.\n\nNotes: Granted by Mystra, Mother of All Magic, of the Forgotten Realms setting.

        "Introduction": "This highly specialized and rarely-granted spell is available only to priests of the Celtic deity Belenus who have attained 10th level. It is granted but once per year, and is the most important spell in the dedication of a circle of standing stones (see special section). The casting of the spell requires an entire week. Any interruption negates its effects, and the priest must start over. A priest using this spell has one year to create a circle of stones. Failure to do so means the patron deity takes back this (and all the priest's other spells), never again to be bestowed. (Theoretically, in an extraordinary case of exceptional service, a disgraced priest might be reinstated, but there is no evidence this has ever happened.)\n\nThe deity allows only one attempt to construct a circle of standing stones each year.\n\nThe material component is a small stone quarried from the same place as the stones used in the circle. It must be collected after the stones have been placed in position.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Celtic god Belenus, a sun god and patron of druids. (In campaigns not using a traditional Celtic pantheon, the local equivalent might be substituted by the DM.)",
        "Standing Stones": "The purpose of a circle of standing stones is to intensify the effect of druidic magic and to create a center of magical power. The site is dedicated to one sphere of magic available to druids (for example, standing stones-divination), and once completed, the site functions permanently unless extraordinary means are taken to destroy it\n\nOnce the circle is created, ceremonies can take place at the site to cast spells of the appropriate sphere. The total number of levels of participating druids can be used as a multiplier upon any of the following: range, duration, or area of effect Thus, if 50 levels of druids are conducting a ceremony to cast an animate object spell, then they could either multiply the range by 50 (to 1500 yards), multiply the duration by 50 (to 50 rounds per level of the caster), or multiply the area of effect by 50 (to 50 cubic feet per level). One of the priests must actually cast the spell, and that priest's level provides the basis from which all other spell information is derived.\n\nThe creation of a standing stones site is a lengthy process. The site must have the stones available and be at least 5 miles from any other standing stones. At least 50 levels of priests, (worshipping at least four different Celtic gods) are required. One must be a 10th level priest of Belenus able to cast the enchant stones spell. All of the priests must spend an entire month assembling the stones and attending ceremonies. The enchant stones spell must be cast at the end of each week and again at the end of the construction. If the priests are interrupted in any way during this time, the enchantment fails and they must start again.\n\nThe exact size and number of stones may vary; it is only important that they be arranged in a series of circular patterns. A typical site is 10 to 30 meters across, and its stones are arranged to follow the seasons, stars, constellations, suns, moons or similar celestial patterns."

Thus, an individual could be active for 24 hours (out of necessity), gradually suffering fatigue, receive this spell, and return to normal functioning instantly. For those who are already well rested, the spell cancels the need for sleep in the next 24 hours. It does not, however, allow the recovery of spells. The spell affects one creature for every two levels of the caster.\n\nThe material component is a pinch of sand.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, fatigue, tires a creature as if it had not slept in the last 24 hours. The creature is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effects. An affected creature has a penalty of -2 to attack rolls, a penalty of -1 to all saving throws, and its movement is reduced to two-thirds the normal rate. In addition, if it does not rest within 12 hours, it collapses from exhaustion and sleeps for 10 hours. If sleep is impossible, the creature is unable to take any type of effective action. Eight hours of rest (if taken before collapse occurs) negates this spell.\n\nThe material component is a small noisemaker.\n\nNotes: Common for priests from an oriental setting; otherwise, very rare."

A successful saving throw vs. spell negates the effect, but each creature affected must attempt a separate saving throw. Note that some water deities may consider the use of the enfeeble water creature spell a hostile act.\n\nThe material component for both versions is the caster's holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for aquatic or seagoing priests."

        "Introduction": "The name of this spell comes from a poetic name for magic attributed originally to the elves. Eternal flame can be cast to affect an item or a body. If this spell is cast on an object or body that has a volume more than twice that of the caster, it fails and is wasted.\n\nTransmitted only by direct touch, this spell imbues an item with a receptive neutral enchantment that causes it to readily accept later magics cast or transferred by dweomerflow spells, for example) into it. In other words, eternal flame allows magic to be fed into an item simply by casting spells in the normal way and choosing the item as the target, but then willing the spell to enter and not harm the item. (In other words, it makes a dweomerflow spell unnecessary unless a spell is being transferred from another item such as a focal stone.) One spell or magical effect per level of the caster of the eternal flame can enter the affected item without a saving throw being needed for the item, any chance of the transfer failing, or any damage occurring to spell or item. There is no time limit to this entry of powers, but the opportunity to imbue them is ended by the casting of an awakening spell on the item.\n\nNote that unlike the enchant an item spell, eternal flame merely allows an item to hold enchantments within itself – it does not enchant the item so as to allow it to emit enchantments flowed into it as controllable powers. In other words, an item affected by an eternal flame spell bears a dweomer and can hold magics within it, but it is not a usable magical item until the magics to give it powers have been conveyed into it and an awakening spell successfully cast upon it. (In other words, this spell handles only the very beginnings of the process that the enchant an item spell encompasses.) Unless or until power transfer occurs and an awakening spell is cast, the item is an item storing magic that no one can call upon in any controlled way – though if the item itself is shattered. the magics within it usually find instant and explosive release.\n\nThis spell can be cast on living, dead, or undead mammalian bodies by touch. It completely attunes body tissues to fully receive a spell. The next spell to come into contact with a body prepared by an eternal flame spell takes full effect, exhibiting maximum possible duration, beneficial effect, damage, or whatever – even if a saving throw is normally necessary for the body to be affected at all – and does not require the affected being to make any saving throw, system shock survival roll, or resurrection survival roll, even if one is normally imperative (a turning attempt is not a spell.) Two schools of wizardry spells are exceptions to this: enchantment/charm and illusion/phantasm. An eternal flame does not cause the effectiveness of enchantment/charm or illusion/phantasm spells to be changed for the affected body at all.\n\nThe material component of an eternal flame spell is a spark struck by the impact of an item bearing a dweomer from a rock, bladed weapon, or metal item that bears some sort of dweomer. (Neither item is harmed in any way by the spell.)\n\nNotes: Very rare spell from the Forgotten Realms setting."

This continual shifting ruins most clothing (and harms the caster if armor more rigid than studded leather is worn, at 1d4+1 points per round), but effectively conceals the caster's identity.\n\nThe parade of everchanging limbs causes the caster to temporarily lose 3 points of Dexterity, and to make all attacks at a -1 penalty on attack rolls and a -2 penalty on damage rolls, but Armor Class benefits by 4 points. The spell does not change the upright, bipedal, flightless, air-breathing nature of the caster (though it can operate in conjunction with spells that do permit flight or underwater breathing). It does make the casting of many spells impossible. The forms taken are not controlled by the caster (the shapes of specific individuals or monsters cannot be counterfeited), and the forms change at a rate that the caster cannot dominate – but limbs actually in use do not vanish, only alter in length and appearance. The strength and senses of the caster are not altered by the spell.\n\nThe everchanging self spell requires no system shock rolls for the alterations it causes, and adds a +20% bonus to all system shock rolls forced on the caster by external forces while the spell lasts.\n\nMask refuses to grant any variant of this spell that affects others. The spell is customarily employed to carry out a fairly simple task in public, when the caster wishes to scare observers or not be identified by them. It was developed to allow trapped Maskarran clergy to escape through crowds of observers after thefts occurred.\n\nNotes: Granted by Mask, Lord of Shadows, of the Forgotten Realms setting.

If more than two arrows are ever withdrawn in one round, the spell effect ends immediately, and only the first two arrows withdrawn do not deplete the real supply. If anyone aside from the caster tries to withdraw an arrow from an endless quiver, the spell effect ends immediately as well.\n\nThe caster can withdraw any type of arrow that was found within the everfull quiver when the spell was cast. Thus, if the priest casts everfull quiver on a quiver containing one flight arrow, one sheaf arrow, and one silver arrow, he could then withdraw two silver arrows, one silver arrow and one flight arrow, etc. per round. No arrow drawn from an everfull quiver while the spell effect lasts is magical, even if the one or more arrows in the everfull quiver is magical.\n\nIf an arrow drawn from an everfull quiver is not immediately employed, it fades into nothingness in two rounds. Once shot, an arrow drawn from an everfull quiver cannot be reused, but will not vanish.\n\nThe material components of this spell are the priest's holy symbol, a quiver, and two or more arrows, none of which is consumed in the casting.\n\nNotes: Granted by the elven god Solonor Thelandira."

This includes control of a creature by some force in an object, possession by magic jar spell, demonic possession, curse, and even charm, for the exorcise spell is similar to a dispel magic spell. Furthermore, it affects a magical item if such is the object of the exorcism. Thus, a soul object of any type affected by a successful exorcism expels the life force contained, to inhabit its nearest material body, wholly and completely.\n\nThe exorcise spell, once begun, cannot be interrupted, or else it is spoiled and useless. The base chance for success is a random 1% to 100%. Each turn of exorcism the dice are rolled, and if the base chance number, or less, is rolled, the spell is successful. The base chance of success is modified by -1%for each level of difference between the priest's level of experience and the level of the possessor or possessing magic, where the smaller number is the priest's level. In the obverse, a +1% cumulative is added. The referee can assign a base chance according to the existing circumstances, if desired.\n\nThe material components for this spell are the holy symbol of the priest and holy water (or unholy symbol and unholy water, in the case of evil priests). A religious artifact or relic can increase the chance of success by from 1% to 50%, according to its power.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for clerics."

Failure ends the spell, subjecting the savant to possible attack from the enraged spirit. If the exorcism fails, another attempt can be made 24 hours later.\n\nAt the completion of the casting time, the spirit must make a successful saving throw vs. spell or be forced back to the realm of the dead. Success means the creature is driven away, remaining in the general area but losing one-fourth of its hit points. If subsequent exorcisms reduce the spirit to zero hit points, it is permanently driven from the area.

        "Introduction": "This spell allows the caster to remove a spirit that is bound into an object, and place it in another container. The spell works only on spirits bound into objects. This includes naturally bound spirits (for example, tree spirits or the spirits of springs and fields) and those bound by another shaman's magic (such as fetish spirits). If the spirit does not wish to be extracted, it is allowed a saving throw vs. spell. The spell has no effect on spirits set to guard an area or merely constrained not to wander.\n\nSome benevolent shamans use these spells to rescue doomed spirits, like moving the spirits of dying trees into a seed or sapling. This is not as pointless as it might sound, as the rescued spirit is likely to be grateful, and may spread word of the caster's kindness, which might make other, more potent spirits friendly towards the caster.\n\nMost shamans, however, use the spell to create spiritual alarms or guards. The two usual uses of such spirits are listed below. Inventive casters may find other uses for them, the success or failure of such attempts to be adjudicated by the DM.\n\nIf the object into which the spirit is placed is carried by the shaman, it allows him to sense the approach of spirits and living creatures. The range of this ability depends on the power of the creature or spirit: it extends up to a distance of 10 yards per Hit Dice or level of the approaching being; a 5 Hit Die monster is detected when it moves within 50 yards, a 3 Hit Die monster within 30 yards. The shaman does not know, however, in which direction the being is, how far away it is, which way it is moving, nor what it actually is. In crowded areas (where the number of creatures or spirits exceeds the shaman's Intelligence score) the shaman cannot keep track of the total number of beings present, and the ability becomes effectively useless.\n\nIf the spirit object is placed in a room, on a path or passage, or in another area, the shaman can tell if any creature or spirit passes through the area. An area up to 10 yards across can be monitored in this way. If several spirits are set as guards in this manner, the shaman cannot tell which specific one has been passed, only that one of them has been.\n\nThe spell requires a container for the spirit, which must be an object for which the spirit has a natural affinity: for example, a tree spirit might be placed in a piece of wood, while a river spirit would better be stored in a jar of water. When the spirit is released, the object crumbles; if the object is broken, the spirit is also released.\n\nNotes: Restricted to shamans, uncommon."

A falling wall spell affects such constructions as if weather had worked on them for long periods. It causes mortar to crumble, drives stones apart, and even causes walls to collapse. The precise effects of this spell are adjudicated by the DM in accordance with the prior condition of the wall and the situation. (For example, weakening a culvert through which water is rushing is quite likely to cause parts of it to break off and be carried away by the flow, enlarging the opening, but trying to break a hole in a strong, thick, unbroken, and fairly new wall is probably hopeless.)\n\nThe caster can affect a maximum area of 5 cubic feet per level, but the extent of this is up to the priest (it can be along a surface or directed into a narrow cylinder sent straight through a wall). Natural rock formations, however fragile or unstable, are not affected by this magic, only artificial constructions. Carvings that leave a solid piece of rock as their result are also immune to the effects\n\nthat are aided by spells or props before or during the operation of the spell are fairly likely to withstand the spell, but small stone pieces are easily shattered by use of this spell.\n\nNotes: Granted by the woodland god Silvanus of the Forgotten Realms setting. This spell is found only in a few exceptionally rare tomes."

If the creature is out of range, the viper fades away instantly and the spell is lost. Otherwise, it darts toward the selected foe. If it hits, the creature suffers the same number of points of damage as it has caused the caster during the same day as the casting of fangs of retribution (no saving throw).\n\nThe viper like flying mouth is AC 1 and MV Fl 15 (A), striking at THAC0 15 on its first round of existence, THAC0 12 on the second, and THAC0 10 on the third. It fades away either at the moment it hits (or someone else hits it) or at the end of the 3rd round if it has failed to strike the selected creature successfully (the caster cannot switch creatures once the spell is cast). The bite of fangs of retribution inflicts no damage if sent against a creature that has not harmed the caster. Once the fangs are launched, the caster is free to undertake other spellcasting or activities without affecting their operation.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a fang from any type or size of snake.\n\nNotes: Granted by Ilmater, the One Who Endures, of the Forgotten Realms setting.

        "Introduction": "This spell allows the shukenja to foresee the general course of a subject's life. Both the shukenja and the one for whom the spell is cast must be present at the casting. Significant details of the subject's life must be known – birth date, past deeds, family, etc. Upon casting the spell, the shukenja delves into the possible paths for the subject's future life. At the end of the spell, the shukenja is able to predict some major future event in the subject's life. Neither the subject or the shukenja has any control over the nature of the event predicted; that is, specific questions cannot be asked or answered. Nor are the exact circumstances of the event known (date, location, etc.). Indeed, the shukenja is only able to provide general statements about the future of the subject.\n\nWhen this spell is cast, there are two ways the DM can decide the answer. If the DM knows of some event that will occur, this can provide the answer. Thus, if the DM knows that the subject will shortly incur the wrath of a ninja family, he can respond “Soon your life will be fraught with danger from someone whose wrath you have incurred. You must expect danger from unexpected sources and friendly strangers. Courage, cunning, and caution should enable you to prevail.” A DM who knows of no particular event can roll on the table.\n\nThe statements given above are quite general and many provide the basis for adventures. The DM should secretly note the fate of the individual and then arrange for the events to come about, creating an adventure to fit. The DM can also create other fates as desired. The fate is not an absolute event and unyielding, rather it is the potential for what may occur. The actions of the subject are the player's choice and these may change the final outcome. Indeed, knowing his fate allows the individual to better prepare himself to meet and avoid it.\n\nAn individual can have only one fate at a time. Once determined, the nature of the event cannot be changed although the outcome can occur differently if the subject's actions accomplish this. Determining a fate does not make the individual immune to death; that is, the subject can still die before his selected fate comes to pass, especially if he behaves in a rash or stupid manner. However, in most cases, the subject should live to see his fate fulfilled, even if he only survives for a few seconds after it has happened.\n\nThe material components for this spell are incense, astrological charts, and a silver gong.\n\nNotes: Common for a priest from an oriental setting; otherwise, very rare."

Usually, the favor spell is cast upon a great hero, such as Odysseus or Jason, just before the hero undertakes a magnificent deed.\n\nThe effectiveness of the spell depends upon how the priest's god views the glory of the deed to be undertaken. Usually, as the god's favor is somewhat arbitrary – this is determined by rolling 1d6. For the duration of the spell, the recipient's saving throws are modified (in the positive direction) by the result. In cases of especially glorious undertakings, the DM may assign a saving throw modifier.\n\nIn addition, the subject is blessed by a pledge of one godly intervention. In practical terms, this means that, during the duration of the spell, the subject can reroll any single die roll that affects him or her personally. The recipient invokes this pledge of intervention only once, even if the second roll was unsuccessful.\n\nThe gods never grant more than one favor spell to a single group of adventurers or a single adventurer, and usually insist that the spell be cast upon the group's leader. If a second favor spell is attempted, both it and the first are lost.\n\nNotes: Rare spell, typical of the classical Greek pantheon."

He becomes immune to paralysis, poison, and attacks that drain Strength or energy levels. Poison attacks require a saving throw vs. poison only when the spell expires. The immunity to pain does not protect the person from damage: but does block penalties due to excessive pain.\n\nThe person's body looks just like an animated corpse – the skin color changes, and flesh shrinks to show bones. His joints become stiff and his movement jerky. When he attacks, it is as a normal zombie, striking last in the melee round. The person's attire does not change; he must attend to the state of his clothes himself. Spells that normally affect undead have no influence over him, which might reveal his true nature.\n\nMost creatures seeing the person will assume the individual is a zombie. Actual undead won't attack the person unless ordered to do so. If the individual does something out of character for a zombie, then the chances that an intelligent creature deduces that he is not what he seems increases. On the Demiplane of Dread, casting this spell requires a Ravenloft powers check.\n\nThe material component for this spell is a bit of bone and dirt from a grave.\n\nNotes: Common for priests from the Demiplane of Dread."

The conditions can be as simple or as complex as the player likes, but they must be written. Some possible conditions are: whenever anyone sets foot in this grove, or, whenever templars draw their weapons.\n\nWhen the condition is met, the area is engulfed in flames, and those inside take 6d8 points of damage. The site continues to burn normally, and anyone trapped takes 1d4 points of damage until the fire burns itself out.\n\nThe area affected is 90 feet square, or its equivalent, and the engulfing flames rise to a height of 10 feet.

        "Introduction": "This spell makes stone flow like syrup, and then harden. The stone flows in response to gravity, but can be directed by beings (such as skilled dwarves) wielding wooden paddles or erecting temporary dams. The flowing stone is not heated or altered in hue. Dwarves often use this spell to shape stone conduits, by flowing stone around logs that are later burnt away, and to sculpt stone into smooth door surrounds, covering or shielding embedded locks and the like.\n\nThe spell can also allow escape from stone prisons, by using wooden poles to open holes in the melted stone of walls and to uproot manacle bolts or other fastenings. Its most deadly use is to trap beings by entombing them or encasing their feet or other body parts in the hardening stone.\n\nAny creature in contact with flowing stone is allowed a saving throw vs. poison. If successful, the creature entirely avoids having stone cling or envelop any part of it. It wins free of the affected area without harm (but must save again upon reentering).\n\nA creature that fails this save is partially encrusted with stone, slowed in movement rate, and suffer a two-point Dexterity penalty until the stone is washed off (within 2 rounds) or shattered and scraped off (thereafter).\n\nIf an encrusted being is immobile, or is in the center of an affected area more than 10 feet across when the round of flowing ends, a saving throw vs. spell is also necessary. If it fails, the being is stuck. A Strength check is allowed to beings struggling against the hardening stone. If successful, they reach the edge of the affected area, emerging with one or more limbs encased in immobilizing blobs of stone. Failure traps the creature in the hardening stone. If stone covers breathing organs (in most beings, the head), death occurs in 1d4+1 rounds. If stone merely prevents movement, the being dies of starvation in 1d10+10 days, or whenever overcome by rising\n\nwater, attacking beasts, or the like.\n\nAttacks on the stone transmit half damage directly to the trapped person; an encased limb can typically be freed by either amputating it (loss of one-quarter hit points, plus an immediate system shock survival roll), or inflicting 20 points of crushing or piercing damage on the stone (10 points to the trapped being). A second flowstone\n\nspell can free trapped beings without harm.\n\nThe material components of this spell are a drop of water, a daub of mud, a grain of sand, and a pebble.\n\nNotes: Granted by the dwarven goddess Sharindlar"

The spell activator has total control over the ship's direction and distance. If no direction is chosen, the DM can choose one at random, using the rules governing grenade-like missiles in the DMG.\n\nThe incomplete spell remains effective for one day per level of the caster (for example, a 16th level priest could cast the spell, and at any time within the next 16 days speak the final words – and the ship she was in would instantly lunge as she desires).\n\nIf the priest is killed or feebleminded between casting and the end of effectiveness period, the spell is lost (normal sleep or unconsciousness do not count).\n\nIf the priest is in contact with two ships when the spell is activated, nothing occurs. The spell's magical field can be centered only on the priest and on a single ship.\n\nThis spell does not work upon any ship currently under power (for example, being moved by spelljamming, a furnace, or other power source), but does work in wildspace, phlogiston, and atmospheres alike. It cannot affect a ship who's total tonnage (atmosphere excluded) exceeds the limits of the caster's area of effect – if tried, the spell is lost.\n\nThe material components are two small pieces of any metallic, magnetized substance (or natural lodestones) and a small sphere of crystal.\n\nNotes: Common for spelljamming cultures; otherwise very rare."

At the time the spell is cast, roll an item saving throw for the gemstone vs. magical fire (rock, crystal vs. magical fire). Success means that the spell is successful: failure destroys the gemstone. Gemstones of above-normal quality may receive a bonus to the saving throw at the DM's discretion (usually from +1 to up to +3 for flawless or otherwise extremely exceptional quality stones).\n\nThe gemstone glows with a soft internal radiance once focal stone is cast (which in some markets raises its value), and it emits a faint dweomer. If immersed in a poisonous liquid, the focal stone turns a vivid purple and can be commanded by touch and will to neutralize poison. If so commanded, the focal stone dissolves and is destroyed, but it leaves the liquid safe to drink or touch.\n\nA focal stone otherwise has no special properties; contrary to popular belief, it cannot reach out and trap spells cast near it or suck in passing enchanted creatures, though it is an ideal receptacle for the life force of a being using a magical spell. The focal stone spell does not prevent the focal stone from being shattered by deliberate attack (a crushing blow, for instance), but does prevent it from being damaged by natural and magical heat, flame, lava, extreme cold, or mineral contamination. Shattering a focal stone immediately unleashes the full effects of any spell stored in it in a manner determined by the DM. A dispel magic cast on such a stone does not affect it or any stored magics.\n\nThe material component is a pinch of any sort of opal dust.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell in the Forgotten Realms setting."

This spell confers one such protection and is discharged in doing so.\n\nIt is a sin to cast this spell on anyone not of chaotic good alignment unless they are directly acting as a formal champion of Tymora (or to aid or protect Tymoran clergy). The spell simply does not work if cast on an evil creature or applied to its caster. There are instances of rulers and rich people persuading Tymoran priests to give them fortunate fate protections, but the clergy have undertaken this the sin only in return for a service or donation of great value (100,000 gold pieces or more, or the gift of lands and legal changes that make more temples possible) to the faith. This is typically done after consultative prayer, and Tymora usually sends a vision of what service or penance the priest must perform – or a stern prohibition not to cast the spell on the supplicant at all. In the days when many Halruuans used skyships, a fortunate fate protection was a coveted protection against death by falling.\n\nNotes: Granted by Tymora.

The spell affects 20 Hit Dice of creatures per casting (usually ten 2nd level Celtic warriors). For its duration, the frenzy of the Cells spell allows those affected to never check morale, gives them a +1 to all saving throws and attack rolls, and allows them to move 50% more than their normal distance without penalty. Those affected immediately charge the closest enemy forces and engage them in combat, whether this is wise or not. Warriors under a frenzy of the Celts spell do not require leadership, but those who recover from the spell without a leader in sight will run back to their own lines or some other point of safety.\n\nThe material component for this spell is a tiny chariot wheel and a spark created with flint and steel.\n\nNotes: Restricted to priests of Celtic cultures, common."

Like the lst-level wizard spell unseen servant, this spell creates an invisible, mindless, and shapeless force. This force cannot fight and, unlike an unseen servant, it cannot affect its physical surrounding except as indicated below.\n\nThe priest casts this spell by walking the perimeter of the area of effect sprinkling pinches of sand every few feet and then returning to the center of the area of effect. Once the spellcasting is completed, the shadowy sentry stands guard in the center of the area of effect and the caster immediately falls asleep.\n\nIf any visible object over 1 foot in length, width, or height which was not present during the casting of the spell enters the area of effect while the spell is in operation or if the spell is about to end, the shadowy force silently shakes the caster awake. When the caster awakes, the priest is wide awake and aware that something has triggered the sentry or that the spell has ended. The spell then immediately expires.\n\nA visible object must be an object that a guard could have perceived with normal vision if she or he had been awake and on guard duty. Visible objects cannot be invisible, hiding in shadows, or hidden behind walls, trees, or earth.\n\nIf this spell is cast by a priest of 5th level or higher, the sentry of Helm also has 60-foot infravision in addition to normal sight, and what is visible to it includes beings seen with that faculty.\n\nThe material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol and a small bag of fine sand."

A ghost knight can't speak or unleash magic, but it can move about and gesture as its caster wills it, and it can carry a single nonliving item (such as a sword, a scroll, a rope, or the like). The carried item can bear an enchantment and can be something harmful that can be dropped on foes from above or activated from afar by the caster or another being.\n\nA ghost knight always walks about (at MV 12), but it can walk on empty air at any visible altitude or in the ground or in walls so that only a part of it appears above or outside the surface. A carried item can't pass into or through such things, and is left behind if the caster directs the knight to enter or pass through solid objects.\n\nThe caster must be able to see the ghost knight in order to direct it at least once during each round of its existence or it simply slops until visual contact is reacquired. A ghost knight has no corporeal existence. It carries things by means of magical force. It cannot snatch things, stop someone from taking what it is carrying, or be struck or harmed in any way. Contact with a dispel magic spell and certain magical barriers, instantly destroys a ghost knight, causing it to wink out.)\n\nA ghost knight can launch apparent attacks (with illusory weapons). These cause a momentary chilling sensation in any living creatures struck by the knight – such attacks inflict no damage. The ghost knight can carry a real weapon just as it might any other object, but can wield it in battle only by dropping it from above (attempts to do this use the caster's THAC0 with a -3 penalty).\n\nThe priest casting this spell can elect to make more than one ghost knight appear. One for each level of the caster above 5th can be created, to a maximum of 20 knights. Each ghost knight can carry one item, and their movement can be coordinated: one knight can pass its item to another (who is empty-handed), and separate items can be held so as to work together (shields overlapping to form a wall, for example).\n\nA ghost knight can counterfeit the gestures of spellcasting or aim a real magical item, but it cannot cast spells, pass on magical effects by its touch, or otherwise interact with unleashed magic.\n\nThe material component is a piece of metal armor of any size. This can be fragmentary, rusted, or damaged, but must have been worn into a battle in which at least one being died.\n\nNotes: Granted by the god Kelemvor, Judge of the Damned, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

The giant spiders are unable to spin webs, but can readily navigate in existing webs (even the sticky strands of web or spellweb spells).\n\nIf spellcasting is interrupted for any reason, or the spiders used already bear a magical dweomer (for example, they are other creatures polymorphed into spiders), the spell is ruined. They are freed from arachnid form by the attempt to use them in a giant spider spell, and the would-be caster is stunned (unable to think or act coherently) for 1 round.\n\nThe material components are the priest's holy symbol and the arachnids to be transformed.

        "Introduction": "Gloom is essentially an underwater version of the obscurement spell, adapted for sahuagin preferences. The spell clouds the water in a 40-foot-diameter globe centered on the spell's recipient, which can be a creature, object, or point in space. Unwilling creatures receive a saving throw vs. spell to negate the effect. Placing the spell on a mobile creature or object creates a mobile effect.\n\nWithin the globe of cloudy water, visibility falls to 2d4 feet for most creatures. Sahuagin, however, can see twice as far (4d4 feel). All light sources – including magical sources such as continual light – dim within the area of effect. A light source's radius remains unaffected, but the light becomes highly diffused, equaling the brightness of a half moon. (A light or continual light spell cast on a creature's eyes, however, still blinds the creature if it fails its saving throw). Within the globe, all saving throws vs. light-based attacks receive a +2 bonus (this negates the sahuagin's racial penalty against light attacks). If the attack does not allow a saving throw, creatures within the globe still resist the effect on a roll of 18 or higher on 1d20; any magical saving throw adjustments still apply to the roll. Above water, this spell creates a cloud of acrid smoke. The spell's duration halves above the surface (round fractions down), and even a slight breeze disperses it in a single round.\n\nNotes: Restricted to sahuagin: uncommon."

        "Introduction": "This spell allows priests to unleash a beam of power from a glowstone or make normal stone (in a surface area of up to 1 square foot per level of the caster) radiate a continual light radiance, for 1 turn per level. If the priest desires, the radiance of normal stone can be accompanied by a gentle release of heat: that is, enough to warm chilled beings to prevent frostbite, death from exposure, and to ensure comfortable sleeping and activity in exposed or icy-cold conditions.\n\nWhen used on a glowstone touched by the caster, this magic unleashes a beam of power. A beam of power is a cutting beam of radiant force that rends stone, wood, and flesh alike. It is typically used as a weapon or as a tool to quarry stone or open passages in solid rock.\n\nA beam of power inflicts as much damage to wood or stone objects as a heavy catapult hit. It deals 6d6 points of damage per contact to living things. In either case, a beam of power is mentally aimed with the same THAC0 as if the priest were attacking directly. It lashes out to its furthest extent (30 feet) in a single round, and can be directed as a continuous stream or pulsed (interrupted and resumed). In either case, other spellcasting, death, or unconsciousness on the part of the caster ends the beam of power and the spell instantly. Beams of power can be tracked in any direction while cutting or to follow a moving target (at MV 15). A beam of power lasts for as long as the caster concentrates. to a maximum duration of 1 round per level of the caster.\n\nThe material component is a pinch of gold-or gem-dust, which is sprinkled on the glowstone or surface to be affected.\n\nNotes: Granted by the dwarven god Marthammor Duin.",
        "Glowstone": "A glowstone is a magical power source used by the dwarves. When created, a glowstone has 1,000 charges and cannot be recharged. It is a clear, faceted, oval, as long as a man's hand, and radiates light equal to a continual light spell.\n\nThe stone can recharge magical items at the rate of one charge per mm. It can give an item with limited charges in a set time period (for example, a device usable twice per day) an additional use after it has been exhausted, at the cost of 7 charges and five rounds of contact with the glowstone. Unleashing a beam of power uses 20 charges per round. A fully drained glowstone fades silently and the stone crumbles to dust.\n\nA glowstone can be destroyed by disintegration or by receiving a total of 66 or more points of damage in a single round. The latter method causes the stone to explode for 1d10 points of damage per charge remaining to all creatures within 30 feet (save vs. spell for half damage).\n\nA glowstone attaches itself to magical items. The effect is similar to magnetism, but it can be pulled free with some effort. While attached to a charged item, the stone will not only recharge it, but any charges used are drawn from the glow-stone instead of the item.\n\n\n * * It is reputed that a creature holding two glowstones together and transferring their energy through its body will be purified of all poisons, diseases, parasitic infestations, and foreign materials embedded in its body."

Members of other faiths worshiping good-aligned deities can use it.\n\nhowever. The conditions, limitations, and material components for casting a glyph of warding: Telatha are the same as for a normal glyph of warding.\n\nWhen triggered, Telatha explodes with the intense brightness of the rising sun, automatically stunning the creature that triggered it for one round.\n\nThe triggering creature is also permanently blinded unless it makes a successful saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is successful, the blindness lasts only 1d6 turns. (Creatures employing magical darkness at the time they trigger this glyph suffer only 1d4 rounds of blindness, as darkness and the glyph negate each other – but the darkness must already be operating. No known magic can trigger and unleash darkness quickly enough to withstand Telatha's effects.)\n\nNotes: Common for priests of Lathander; otherwise, uncommon in the Forgotten Realms setting.

A goad of misfortune functions in all respects as an iron footman's mace, except that it inflicts 4d4 points of damage per blow (save for half).\n\nIt can be set aside to free the caster's hands for doing other things (such as unrelated spellcasting), but vanishes instantly but if touched by a being other than the cater, it vanishes instantly unless the caster is also in direct contact with it.\n\nWhen a goad of misfortune is specifically used to strike against any armor, weapon, or item (that is, if its wielder tries to harm the item and not its wearer or carrier, or if the item is successfully used to parry a goad attack), the item must make a successful item saving throw vs. crushing blow or be destroyed. Whenever the goad deals damage to a creature, its wielder is healed of 2 points of damage (but cannot gain extra hit points in this fashion, even temporarily).\n\nAn attack that deals damage to a being also empowers the goad to dimension door itself and its wielder (as the wizard spell, but with a 90-yard maximum distance and no recovery time necessary). This power vanishes if not used within 1 turn of the attack that enabled it. Successful multiple attacks can build up multiple dimension door trips to a maximum of three, which the caster can use later or even in succession, so long as a full turn does not elapse between the strike and teleportation.\n\nWhen created, a goad of misfortune normally coalesces in the hand of its caster. The spell range refers to an alternative version of this spell in which the goad is rendered invisible and set above a specific spot (typically a doorway or over a chair). It hangs in midair, waiting to strike any being except the caster who enters its 10-foot by 10-foot by 20-foot high area of activation. It attacks only once, striking with the caster's THAC0 and dealing 4d4 points of damage (no saving throw). This form of the goad has none of the additional powers possessed by the caster-wielded form.\n\nThe material component is an iron rod of at least the length of the caster's arm and the thickness of a thumb. This rod must have been forged, shattered and reformed. It is consumed in the casting.\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil goddess Beshaba. Maid of Misfortune, of the Forgotten Realms setting.

The temperature and/level of wind are moderated toward a more comfortable level for the subject. Temperature is adjusted by as much as 20º and wind speed by as much as 10 miles per hour. Note that “comfort” is subjective, varying from race to race. For instance, what a thri-kreen finds tolerable is sweltering for a halfling.\n\nFor example, if the spell was cast on a human while the temperature outside the radius is 100º and the wind speed is 5 miles per hour, the good weather spell would adjust the temperature to 80º and the wind speed to 0 within the area of effect. If the spell was cast on a thri-kreen, the temperature would be raised to 120º and the wind speed to 15 miles per hour.\n\nEvery creature within the sphere that is made more comfortable by the spell receives a +2 bonus to all morale rolls.

Creatures made less comfortable receive a -2 penalty to all morale checks and have their marching speed cut to half for the duration of the spell.

        "Introduction": "This spell creates a mobile, bipedal, upright “shadow person” that resembles a human in form. It floats, “walking” about at MV 12 without actually touching surfaces, and can be controlled by the caster from afar (to the limits of the spell's range), going where the caster cannot or dare not go. Observers cannot see through the smoke like body of this construct, and it quenches magical light and continual light on contact without being itself affected.\n\nA greater creature of darkness can achieve semi-solidity and can carry items of not more than 20 pounds weight. Thus, it can deliver items, wield magical items or regular weapons in combat, and even deliver the touch-discharged spells cast by its caster as if its hands were the caster's own. (All these activities are at the caster's THAC0, but with a -3 penalty to attack rolls.) The construct is not sentient, but is controlled by the will of the caster, who can dimly see through illusory eyes that the shadow person does not, in fact, possess. (The caster cannot hear, smell, taste, or feel textures through the shadow person.)\n\nGaze attacks (such as the petrifying glare of a basilisk) cannot harm the caster through the shadow eyes, but the caster in turn cannot see through the construct well enough to read, see expressions, or even to recognize friends by their features – although gestures can be discerned. The shadow person can open doors (so long as doing so does not require pushing more than 20 pounds of dead weight), unlock things, point at objects or give directions, and conceal the identity of beings by enveloping them.\n\nIf the caster wishes to harm a living being that physically moves into a greater creature of darkness, the caster can make the “shadow person” hit once per round with any one weapon or magical item it carries, or launch a touch-delivered spell attack through the construct for full possible damage. A creature can freely enter or leave a greater creature of darkness effect, though the effect moves with them if its caster desires. The “shadow person” is not dispelled by the entry and exit of other beings. Those entering the shadow can see through it as if its gloom did not exist. Further, they are cloaked by it – to a limit of four small-sized (or smaller) creatures, two man-sized creatures, or one larger than man-sized creature. The darkness expands to cover their bodies and conceal their identities (even several beings at once, although if they move more than 20 feet apart, the construct stays with only one of them).\n\nA caster wearing his or her own greater creature of darkness receives the following benefits: concealment of identity, immunity to blinding or hypnotic lights (including magical effects) and all illusions (including attacks such as shadow monsters). It has two additional powers, but the caster exhausts the spell by calling on either of them. It can act as a feather fall or it can allow the caster to levitate for up to four consecutive rounds.\n\nThe material components are a strand of spiderwebs, a pinch of soot or pitch, a piece of shell, beak, or bone that has been dyed black or blackened in a fire, and a black feather, scale, clump of fur, or piece of skin from any flying creature.\n\nRumors persist that those who know a secret variant of this spell can use one additional power of a greater creature of darkness. If it touches a foe they wish to harm, they can sacrifice some of their own hit points, and instantly deal their opponent double that number of points of damage as a flesh-eating, corrosive attack (no saving throw).\n\nNotes: Granted by the Shar. Mistress of the Night, evil goddess of the Forgotten Realms setting. This spell is found only in a few exceptionally rare tomes."

        "Introduction": "This spell creates an invisible magical aura around its recipient (who must be willing or at least unaware; the spell fails instantly if cast on hostile, unwilling creatures). When a specific spell or magical item discharge (such as fireball, but not all fiery spells) impinges on any part of this aura, the mantle instantly absorbs it, negating all of its effects, and presents the mantle-wearer with a threefold choice: use the spell energy for healing (on the caster or another touched being), convert it to another predetermined specific spell and hurl it back at the source of the first magic, or transform it to a predetermined specific spell and cast it at another target. If the mantle-wearer is not the caster, the caster can elect when bestowing the spell to force the magic to always make one of those choices or to leave each decision up to the\n\nmantle-wearer. (The free choice cannot be restricted to two of the three options, nor can the predetermined spell be left unselected.) If an incoming spell is used for healing, only lost hit points can be replaced. The mantle heals 2 hit points per level of spell absorbed. Furthermore, the hit points gained cannot be split between the\n\nmantle-wearer and another touched recipient – one or the other gains the full benefit.\n\nA given being can enjoy the protection of only one greater mantle of Mystra at a time, and cannot be protected by both a mantle and a greater mantle at once. Neither sort of mantle will survive contact with a dispel magic effect.\n\nThe spell sent forth behaves as if it was launched by a caster of the same level, alignment, and abilities as the caster of the first magic. Its launching, however, depends on the vision and abilities of the mantle-wearer, not the source of the original attacking magic (for instance, if an incoming chain lightning attack is converted to a flame strike and hurled at a third party, the mantle-wearer must be able to see the chosen target for the flame strike).\n\nBoth the specific spell to be defended against and the spell it is to be converted to must be chosen by the caster of the greater mantle of Mystra during its casting and cannot be altered thereafter. The magic defended against must be one the mantle-caster has cast, felt the effects of, or observed, and the specific name known. The mantle-caster must have at some prior time personally cast the magic sent forth. The spell level of the magic sent forth cannot exceed the spell level of magic defended against (for instance, polymorph other cannot be converted to flame strike).\n\nA greater mantle of Mystra defends against multiple attacks of the same sort of spell; it is not exhausted by one incoming spell.\n\nA variant of this spell, Azuth's alteration mantle (see that spell), can be selected by varying the wording of the casting. It protects against two specific spells, converting them into healing energy or both into one specific outbound spell. The restrictions on caster knowledge of the magics involved (noted above) remain unchanged, but the duration of the spell is only four rounds per level of the caster.\n\nNotes: Restricted to priests of Mystra, from the Forgotten Realms setting. This spell is found only in a few exceptionally rare tomes."

The trace ends when the feature passes below a mile underground or the spell expires.\n\nOnly the uppermost layer of multilevel underground features is revealed by the magic. However, the caster is made aware of branching and side passages and can often guess at more than the spell reveals. (For instance, if a tunnel splits and one passage descends and then crosses under the other, that deeper passage could not be followed as it went under the uppermost passage, but it would be apparent again the moment it emerged on the other side.) Although general depth, direction, and size are apparent to a caster looking ahead, full knowledge can be gained only by someone standing directly on the earth above the feature (that is, the presence of water blocks the sight afforded by this spell). The extent of features that can be learned is therefore determined by the caster's movement rate, freedom to move, the terrain, and the availability of marker stakes or something similar – although this spell is most commonly used to decide where to dig a shaft or intercepting passage.\n\nThe material components are a hair from the caster's body and a piece of string, cord, or thread.\n\nNotes: Granted by the nature deities Mielikki and Gwaeron Windstrom of the Forgotten Realms setting"

A guardian hammer strikes only once, but does not miss. When it hits, it appears momentarily as a glowing, translucent hammer and then fades away into nothingness. Its strike does 4d12 damage, and stuns the struck creature for 1d4+1 rounds (no voluntary actions possible). Struck beings must make a successful Strength check to avoid being knocked down, forcing possible item saving throws vs. crushing blow for fragile carried items.\n\nA guardian hammer spell can be destroyed before activation by casting dispel magic on the guarded area or by totally destroying the guarded area without entering it (for example, by disintegration). The latter method destroys all guardian hammer spells attached to an area; the former method destroys only one guardian hammer per dispel magic, if multiple spells exist. Once activated, a guardian hammer can dodge all magical and physical barriers, by way of the Ethereal Plane (phasing in and out) if necessary. It cannot be destroyed or diverted to another target by such means.\n\nThe material components for this spell are a drop of sweat or spittle or a tear from the caster, a hair from a dwarven stone mason, and a pebble or lump of ice.\n\nNotes: Granted by the dwarven god Berronar Truesilver."

A successful check means the creature is not convinced; a failed check means the creature gives credence to the priest's words if no obvious facts contradict them.\n\nFor example, a priest who attempts to gull a guard outside a private club might be able to convince the guard that he is a member of the club, but has forgotten the password (assuming he is dressed appropriately), or convince the guard that his home was just burgled and that it would be okay for him to run home while the priest stands guard in his stead (assuming that the priest is wearing the outfit of a city watchman). However, the priest would have no luck convincing the guard that he is a particular member of the club if the guard has already seen that member enter the club just moments before, nor would he have any luck convincing the guard that he was a member if only humans are permitted to join the club and the priest is obviously a gnome.\n\nThe material components of this spell are the priest's holy symbol and a pinch of sugar.\n\nNotes: Granted by the gnome god Baravar Cloakshadow."

The large hailstone fractures on impact with a hard object (shield, helmet, metallic armor, a wall), inflicting 1 point of damage on any creature within 3 feet of the point of impact. The hailstone does not fracture on impact with soft surfaces. For every two experience levels the caster achieves above 2nd, one additional hailstone can be created (two at 4th, three at 6th, to a maximum of five at 10th level). These can be directed against different foes, provided all are at least partially within a 10-foot cube.\n\nHailstorm. The caster creates a swarm of smaller hail stones. These strike all creatures in a 10-foot cube for 1 point of damage. Each affected creature must also make a successful saving throw vs. spell or be temporarily stunned, losing its next action. At 6th level, the caster can affect a 20-foot cube, and at 10th level the area increases to a 30-foot cube.\n\nThis spell is ineffective underwater and when exposed to high heat (for example, a wall of fire provides complete protection). Since most of the hailstone effect is impact, it affects creatures immune to cold.

The casting of the spell invests a portion of the caster's spirit within the tree and permanently bonds her life force with that of the tree. The link created by a hamatree spell can be severed only by a limited wish or wish.\n\nOnce cast, the caster can literally step through any living, healthy tree and dimension door to the oak tree with which she is bound. Likewise, she can communicate with the tree (as if by speak with plants) whenever in physical contact with it.\n\nThe caster can choose to transfer any damage she suffers to the great oak, up to the maximum of the number of hit points the caster had when she cast the spell. However, transferred fire damage inflicts double damage on the tree. The tree regenerates damage at the rate of one week per point of damage, and this process can be hastened only by means of a plant growth or heal spell, either of which speeds the recovery process to one day per point of damage. Depending upon the age and size of the oak, the tree might have between 7 and 12 Hit Dice, as determined by the DM.\n\nThe great drawback of this spell is that any damage inflicted on the oak with which the caster is bound is suffered equally by the caster, no matter where she may be. Upon the death of the caster, the tree dies immediately. Upon the death of the oak, the caster must immediately make a successful system shock roll or die.\n\nThe verbal and somatic components of this spell require the caster to spend the entire casting time in contact with the tree, while singing to awaken its slumbering spirit. This spell can be cast only once in the lifetime of the caster.\n\nNotes: Granted by the elven goddess Hanali Celanil."

It can punch an opponent chosen by the caster, attacking once per round as a priest of the caster's level. The punch inflicts 2d8 points of damage. The hand is too slow and awkward to grab any object that has a faster movement rate than 3, but a hand grasping a living creature\n\ninflicts 2d6 points of constriction damage per round if the spellcaster so commands.\n\nThe hand can hurl stones as a stone giant if boulders are within its reach.

When the creature would otherwise die, a translucent hand appears to save him. A blow that would strike down the recipient misses, an object falls to block a gout of dragon's breath, and so on. The hand of fale intervenes only after all attack rolls and saving throws are resolved, and death (not just incapacitation) must have been the outcome or the spell is not released. A creature can be affected by only one hand of fate at any given time. The maximum duration of the spell is one hour, plus one hour per level of the casting priest.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell. (Updated from Polyhedron Newszine.)\n\nCastings of this spell are best granted only as a reward for exceptional service or to reinforce a priest confronting an exceptional challenge in which the power's interests are directly involved. Foes may have access to this spell, as well.\n\nThis spell (also known as divine justice) inflicts a fitting punishment for an act of cruelty upon a single living and intelligent subject of the spell. This cannot be ended by dispel magic or other magical effects. It lasts until the hand of Hoar has struck or the subject is dead.\n\nUpon casting the spell, the priest of Hoar must touch the subject and then verbally accuse the creature of some particular injustice committed that caused harm (DM's discretion) to some other creature or to the spellcaster. If the subject fails a saving throw vs. spell, is actually guilty of committing the named injustice, and can understand the priest's accusation, then the spell takes effect. The priest has no way of knowing if the spell has actually taken effect (except to hypothesize if a fitting response occurs following the casting of the spell).\n\nThe vengeance of the hand of Hoar is swift and harsh. For example, if an assassin kills the wrong target and is then subject to the effects of Hoar's divine justice, it is likely the assassin will die while unintentionally foiling a rival assassin's attack on the original target. If a mage imprisons an innocent rival and is then subjected to the effects of the hand of Hoar, it is likely that mage's next spellcasting attempt will take effect within the radius of a spontaneously appearing wild magic region. The resulting miscast spell might result in the mage being imprisoned. The effects of the hand of Hoar vary on a case-by-case basis. They are adjudicated by the DM, but should be suitably ironic – a punishment to fit the crime.\n\nThe spell requires a small token once possessed by the subject and the priest's holy symbol. Neither is consumed in the casting.\n\nNotes: Granted by Hoar the Doombringer of the Forgotten Realms setting."

        "Introduction": "This spell causes a flame to spring from the caster's palm. The flame can be either a reddish tongue that burns and heats, or a whitish light that cannot ignite or harm anything. The caster can cause the flame to be one form or the other as often as desired, switching at the end of a round. Once created, the flame cannot move from the caster's palm.\n\nAs a burning flame, a handcandle can ignite flammable materials, cook food, or scorch beings touched by the caster for 1d4+1 points of damage (unlike the fire of a produce flame spell, it cannot be hurled).\n\nAs a white light, handcandle can touch anything without igniting it. The intensity of its light can be controlled by the caster. (It isn't blinding or as bright as a lantern, but it can be made so dim as to be visible only from a few inches away.) The effect is ideal for reading in poor light, stealthily finding keyholes and the like in darkness, and so on. Many priests use it to impress the gullible by “swallowing fire” or giving their faces an eerie appearance by night, playing with the effects made possible by this light.\n\nA handcandle can be extinguished (ending the spell) instantly whenever its caster desires. In either form, it can withstand even gale force winds (including magical winds) without being extinguished. It does no harm to the caster: many priests who conjure one as a tent light fall asleep with it still shedding light for their companions.\n\nNotes: Granted by Oghma, Lord of Knowledge, in the Forgotten Realms setting."

        "Introduction": "This spell causes one of the caster's hands (or the end of a chosen limb) to be surrounded by tiny winking motes of light that resemble a cluster of constantly renewed sparks. These motes of magic are neither hot nor flammable and do not harm nonliving material. Their light is bright enough to read by if the writing is very near (within the length of the caster's longest finger).\n\nAny living creature struck by the motes (successful attack roll required) takes 1d4+3 points of damage (no saving throw). Undead creatures touched by handfire suffer 2d4+4 points of damage.\n\nThe handfire spell lasts for two attacks (regardless of how long after casting they are delivered) or until willed to dissipate by the caster. The handfire can strike twice in the same round if the caster comes into contact with two different creatures (for example, when the foes punch or run into the priest, rather than the caster trying to strike them). The handfire effect cannot be conducted along weapons or tools; direct contact with some part of a creature's body is required. No known Faerunian armor can stop handfire, although certain magical barriers do.\n\nThe presence of active handfire does not prevent the casting of other spells or alter their effects. Discharge is automatic on contact with any living or undead being who is not the caster, so handfire can accidentally harm friendly creatures, or harm a thief or an attacker even when the caster is asleep, if the active limb is disturbed. (Some priests clutch a magical item with a handfire-active hand as they fall asleep to prevent theft.)\n\nHandfire that is willed out of existence sputters and fades in seconds, becoming harmless in an instant. If it has struck another being once, the caster can will it into his or her body, healing 1 (14 points of any current damage. A caster can mentally choose the color of the handfire sparks (as a signal, for example), but cannot change this once the spell takes effect.\n\nNotes: Granted by Sune, Lady of Love, of the Forgotten Realms setting.

They are simply held until the spell has run its course, as are water weirds, water elementals, or similar creatures composed of animate water. The spell can be negated before its duration expires by a successful dispel magic spell. The caster can also cancel the spell at will.\n\nThe caster can reduce the depth to which the water becomes hard, to a minimum of 6 inches. For example, a priest casting hard water on a river can specify that only the surface of the water become hard, thereby making it possible to walk across.\n\nThe material components of this spell are a flask of water and a stone.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for priests with major access to the sphere of Elemental Water in the Forgotten Realms setting."

        "Introduction": "The spell conjures up a small, mindless spirit (1/2 Hit Die) with no awareness of its own, which enters the body of the target creature and allows the shaman to locate it later.\n\nTo cast this spell, the shaman must play a brief melody on a musical instrument (and must be proficient in the use of such an instrument) while staring at and concentrating upon a single living creature within 15 yards. The creature receives a saving throw vs. paralyzation. If this is successful, the spirit returns to the spirit world and the creature never knows anything was attempted. If the spirit successfully enters the creature, the creature suffers no ill effects, nor does it have any reason to suspect that it has been invaded.\n\nThe easier can thereafter locate the subject any number of times. By playing the same tune again, the shaman gains an intuitive notion of where the creature is and what condition it is in. However, whenever the caster plays the melody to get a fix on the spirit, the notes of the tune can be heard as a ghostly echo by the creature.\n\nDevices and spells that prevent magical detection and scrying do not prevent the shaman from locating the creature, due to the nature of the link. The spell does not extend beyond the Prime Material Plane, so creatures that have gone elsewhere cannot be located.\n\nEach shaman can keep track of only one creature at a time with this spell. Recasting haunting notes on another creature severs contact with the previous subject.\n\nThe spell requires an instrument upon which the tune is initially played (which is not destroyed by the casting). The other components are the sound made by the instrument and the movements required to play it.\n\nNotes: Restricted to shamans, uncommon."

A successful saving throw vs. spell negates the spell. If affected, the creature's need for oxygen, food, water, and such are all but negligible for the duration. The creature can be awakened, but will go back to sleep when it is no longer interrupted unless it makes another saving throw vs. spell. When the spell expires, the creature will awaken with a very intense hunger.\n\nThe caster can affect 1 large creature the size of a bear, 2 man-sized creatures, or 3 smaller creatures. Humans and humanoids are as vulnerable to the spell's effects as any other creature. Sentient or quasi-sentient plants and plant beings will go dormant if subjected to a hibernate spell, just as they would in winter.\n\nThe material component is some fur from a mammal that hibernates.\n\nNotes: Very rare druid spell.

Although these metal objects can be touched, they cannot be moved for the duration of the spell, as if the metal weighed tons or was held fast by sovereign glue.\n\nThis spell is often used to prevent individuals from drawing weapons or from removing metallic or partially metallic objects from the affected area. The spell is especially useful against individuals clad in chain or plate mail. Beings wearing any ferrous armor find that while under the effects of this spell they cannot move. Furthermore, anyone wearing metal or carrying metal items that enters the area of effect of an already operating hold metal spell finds that such metal is instantly rendered immobile – from weapons to metal buttons, from buckles to cloak clasps.\n\nNonferrous metals are unaffected by hold metal, so an individual wearing bronze plate mail or picking up a silver candelabrum is able to proceed normally if the item in question does not have iron or another ferrous metal hidden within it\n\niron).

Saving throws are adjusted for Wisdom. The spell has no effect upon undead creatures that make their saving throws.\n\nHeld undead cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the creature's condition due to, for example, exposure to daylight. The savant casting the hold undead spell can end the spell with a single utterance at any time; otherwise, the duration is five rounds at 5th level, six rounds at 6th level, seven rounds at 7th level, and so on.\n\nThe material component is the priest's holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Restricted to cleric-savants.

The caster touches first the destination item and then any other items that hold magic that is to be drained into the destination item. The items to be drained may be potions, spell scrolls, parchments with magical command words or inscriptions, focal stones, or existing magical items.\n\nA holy vesting creates a shimmering disturbance in the air between the readied recipient item and any items being drained. This shimmering remains visible until the spell ends, whereupon it fades. One power or control property is transferred per round to the destination item. Often, the absorption of powers can be seen by observers due to the sequential disappearance of focal stones, spell scrolls, and the like. Powers and magical controls drained by a wondrous web are transferred intact to the destination item and are there combined harmoniously, being held within the item in stable magical stasis until the item is awakened by use of an awakening spell. (Control conditions are attached to the magics they are intended for, powers that are to work in sequence are arranged that way, and so on.)\n\nOnly existing magical items are allowed a saving throw against this spell. Any item having less than three effects or functions has a base saving throw of 9: any item with four or more effects or functions has a base saving throw of 11 and adds one point per function beyond four. If the item successfully saves against the effect of holy vesting, it is unaffected. If it fails, the holy vesting draws a random function out of it. If any of its effects or functions drain charges to function, they are affected first, and 1d4 charges are transferred per round, not the ability to perform the function. For items lacking charges, the ability to perform the effect is permanently taken from the item, possibly destroying it or rendering it nonmagical. The holy vesting spell provides no mitigation or protection against any explosive effects that might be built into the destruction of an item.\n\nHoly vesting can be ended prematurely if the caster so wills. Whichever magic is in transit (if any remain untransferred when the spell is ended) is ruined and lost, but those that have already entered the destination item are unaffected, as are the powers or properties not yet taken from their original holding places. A dispel magic disrupts a holy vesting spell if the spell is not performed on an altar dedicated to the caster's deity (which provides the spell immunity from dispel magic). Other magical attacks (short of a properly worded limited wish or wish spell) do not affect the vesting. Missiles or thrown weapons that strike the caster while the spell is being cast have the normal likelihood of ruining the casting, but once the holy vesting spell is cast, they have no effect on its progress unless the caster loses consciousness or perishes, which ends the holy vesting prematurely as described above.\n\nThe material components are one drop of holy water consecrated to the caster's deity for the item to be imbued, one for each source of magic to be connected to it, and a stick or block of burned incense.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell from the Forgotten Realms setting, recorded by Volo."

If the spell does not end, the individual eventually may starve, visibly wasting away.\n\nAfter one day under the spell's effect, the individual's concentration suffers (due to a preoccupation with a constant hungry feeling). This causes a -2 penalty to all ability and proficiency checks. On the eighth day without food, an individual who has been maintaining normal activity levels loses 1 Strength point; on the ninth day, 1 Constitution point. This alternating pattern continues until one of the individual's ability scores falls to 3; at this point, the individual becomes comatose. If a score reaches 0 before the hunger spell ends, the individual dies. When the spell ends, lost points are regained at a rate of 1 Strength and 1 Constitution point per day.\n\nWhen casting the spell, the spellcaster secretly whispers a particular type of food; by eating the specified food, the individual breaks the spell. It must be a single, natural food (such as lamb, honey, or an apple) but can be exotic (dragon meat) as long as the caster has tasted it personally at some point.\n\nThe hunger spell cannot be dispelled but can be broken by the remove curse spell. Failing all else, a sufferer must wait until the spell ends.\n\nThe material component is a pinch of the food that can end the spell.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for druids."

From the viewpoint of the cleric, the apparition of the nemesis and the subsequent battle are very real; the fight is played out as if a battle was really taking place between two face-to-face foes that begin 100 feet apart on a flat plain. The spell lasts until the battle ends in the “death” of a participant. Any onlookers merely see the entranced cleric (if the sanctuary effect allows). Failure to win means the cleric must complete a special quest before undergoing the ritual again.\n\nNotes: Restricted to those barbarian clerics whose tribes follow this ritual.

Only stone can be used (either natural stone or petrified objects). The stone must be loose; it cannot be part of a wall, rock face, or ceiling. The projectile strikes with the casters THAC0. The range of this spell refers to the distance between the priest and the potential stone missile. The projectile can leap up to 30 feet vertically and up to 30 feet horizontally. Misses use the grenade-like missile table in the DMG to determine the point of impact.\n\nThe caster can move up to 2 cubic feet of rock per level. Rocks that are too large are felt as such; the priest can choose another rock in the same round. If the second rock it is also too large, the spell is wasted.\n\nAt times it may be important to know what damage the missile itself sustains after being hurled; for instance, if it is a fragile, valuable object, or, say, a petrified companion. The missile suffers 2d4 points of damage from its use in this spell and double that damage if it falls more than 50 feet in the process. This shatters the missile if it is brought to 0 hit points. Assume rocky missiles to have an average total of 6 hit points per 2 cubic feet, so that a rock of the maximum size that a 3rd level priest can move (6 cubic feet) has 18 hit points.\n\nRocky missiles that shatter spray shrapnel; all creatures within 10 feet of the landing site of a missile must successfully save vs. spell or suffer 1d4+1 points of damage.\n\nAny item struck by the missile or its shrapnel (see above) must make an item saving throw vs. crushing blow. A being struck by the missile suffers damage as shown on the table.\n\nThe material component is a tiny pebble, held in the priest's hand and not consumed during casting.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, rock shield, allows the caster to deflect rocky missiles of all types and from all sources. The shield remains in effect for 1 round per level, and is infallible against all missiles whose edges contain or are made of stone. Once cast, it does not require continued concentration or further action. The deflections are in\n\ndirections uncontrollable by the user of the shield. Use the grenade-like missile table from the DMG, noting that deflections can hit companions of the shield-user or his or her enemies. Rock shield is incompatible with protection from normal missiles.\n\nThe reverse of the spell requires two small pebbles (which are not consumed) and a translucent piece of glass, mica, ice, crystal, or a gem.\n\nNotes: Granted by the dwarven goddess Haela Brightaxe."

The magic of the spell protects the fist from all damage while the spell lasts (it can be ended at any time by the silent will of the caster). It improves the casters THAC0 (for smiting blows with the fist only) by 2 points. A blow from an ice spikes fist does 1d4+4 points of damage, and the fist is considered a +2 magical weapon for purposes of determining what it can hit. Note that the spell effect precludes most spellcasting and the performance of many other activities (such as climbing at the usual rate, casting additional spells, tying knots, and so on).\n\nIf the caster willingly sacrifices some of his or her own hit points, the damage done by a single attack with the ice spikes fist can be augmented by a like amount. For example, if 4 hit points are sacrificed by the caster, the blow they empower inflicts 1d4+8 points of damage. Hit points sacrificed are not lost if the attack misses, and are restored by normal rest or healing magic. (A sacrifice is not automatically assumed for the next blow of the fist after a miss; the caster decides separately for each fist attack.)\n\nWhenever an augmented fist attack strikes a natural or magical mass or wall of ice (regardless of how many points have been sacrificed). the caster of the ice spikes spell must make two saving throws vs. spell. If both succeed, the mass of ice shatters and collapses. If only one roll is successful, the struck ice is marred enough to form a handhold, but takes no additional damage. If both throws fail, the target ice is entirely unaffected.\n\nThe material component is an icicle or sliver of ice of any size and origin.\n\nNotes: Granted by Auril, called Frostmaiden, of the Forgotten Realms setting. This spell is found only in a few exceptionally rare tomes."

The protection applies only against attacks made by weapons and weapon-like objects, not attacks made by natural abilities, in addition, creatures wielding weapons or weapon-like objects that can inflict high damage can hit creatures normally immune to normal weapons: eighteen or more points of damage hit as if they had a +1 item, 20 or more points equals a +2 item, 24 or more equals a +3 item, 28 or more points equals a +4, and 30 points or greater is equal to a +5 item.

The spell ends immediately, however, if the designated heir dies before the scion.\n\nIf bloodtheft is attempted with a tighmaevril weapon, the scion must roll a saving throw to prevent losing his or her bloodline and regency. The scion gains a +1 bonus to the roll for every 10 points of regency possessed.\n\nThis spell cannot be cast on an unwilling regent, but the heir can be unwilling. In such a case, the unwilling heir must be restrained during the casting in order for the spell to work.\n\nThe material components are a lock of hair from the scion and heir and a small silver paten on which the hair is placed.

The spellcaster must be careful about the direction chosen and not accidentally jet into an obstruction. Jetting into a solid object, such as a coral reef, the bottom of a ship, or into the sea floor causes 3d6 points of crushing damage. Jetting through plants, such as seaweed or kelp, causes 2d4 points of damage from being whipped by the fronds. If within 10 feet of the surface of the water, a spellcaster can jet straight upward and actually leap out of the water like a dolphin to a height of 1d8 feet. Ixitxachitl priests and sahuagin priestesses sometimes use this leap technique to attack anyone who leans too far over the side of a ship or dock.\n\nWhen jetting away, the priest leaves behind a great cloud of inky darkness that reduces visibility to zero within its confines. The cloud is a large oval shape, 60 feet high, 60 feet wide, and 80 feet long. The cloud lasts for five rounds, suddenly dissipating at the end of the fifth round. It cannot be negated by a light or continual light spell.\n\nThe material components are a small (not necessarily living) squid and a black pearl.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for sea priests; otherwise, very rare.

The druid then plants one stake in the ground, walks up to 100 feet per level away, and plants the other stake. The spell forms an invisible, 30-foot-high barrier extending between the stakes along the path the druid walked. The barrier is 99% likely to cause a normal insect encountering it to turn and go in the opposite direction. If one or several barriers join to completely enclose an area, affected insects depart the area as well. Those insects trapped in the area become lethargic and slowly die off. While the spell remains, the warded area has only 1% of its normal insect population, which will affect the area's ecosystem as insects form a large portion of many creatures' diets. Details of this are left to the DM.\n\nBy means of the runes carved into the stakes, the druid determines what types of insects the spell excludes. This can be specific (for example, only mosquitoes and aphids) or general (for example, all plant-caters, or all blood-drinkers). Giant insects are unaffected, as are magically summoned or controlled insects. The stakes radiate magic until the spell ends. If either stake is removed from the ground, even for a moment, the spell is broken.\n\nNotes: Very rare druid spell. (Updated from Dragon Magazine.)"

        "Introduction": "This spell fills the shukenja with great oratory ability, allowing the priest to explain the wonders of his or her religion to others. When cast, the shukenja sermonizes about the precepts of his or her ethos, attempting to sway or convert his listeners. For the duration of the spell casting, the shukenja is considered to have an 18 Charisma. Furthermore, the caster's words are inspired, providing hope and faith to all who listen. Everyone in the area of effect must make a saving throw versus death. Those who successfully make the saving throw are unaffected by the spell; those who fail are affected. They understand the true meaning of the shukenja's words and become followers of his or her way. Their fervor is not violent or particularly strong (that is, they do not become warriors in the cause of the belief)- Rather, they decide to gain\n\nmore understanding and to make prayers and offerings to the shukenja's deity without disrupting their normal lives. However, those who roll a 1 on the saving throw are particularly moved by the sermon and offer special services or aid if needed. Such converts can become priests (if possible), provide land for a shrine, help construct a temple, and so on Those converted remain followers unless they suffer great misfortune or mistreatment or the ethos (and its priests) abandon the area.\n\nWhen using this spell before a large crowd, rolling individual saving throws can become quite tedious. Therefore, the saving throw can be used as a percentage of the listeners affected. First, determine the average saving throw of the crowd based on the levels or Hit Dice of those listening. This saving throw is then calculated as a percentage, with 1 point of saving throw equal to 5 percentage points. Thus, a saving throw of 16 would indicate that 25% of the crowd is unmoved by the spell, while the remaining 75% decide to adopt the shukenja's beliefs. In addition, 5% of those listening are particularly moved as noted above. To give an example, say that the shukenja instructs a crowd of 87 humans, all 0 level. The average saving throw is 16. of those in the crowd, 65 are moved by the speech (round all fractions down) and 4 of the 65 are fervent in their belief. The DM may wish to keep track of the number of converted NPCs compared to the total population of the village (or what\n\never), especially if the characters are remaining in the same area for an extended period of time. Once an individual has made a saving throw against this spell, that individual is immune to the effects of the spell if used by the same shukenja.\n\nThe creature has heard the shukenja and is unmoved by the words.\n\nNotes: Common for oriental priests; otherwise, very rare."

In the case of a large, interconnected series of buildings (like a castle), each casting affects only a single tower, keep, or wall segment, to a maximum of 1,000 cubic feet per level of the caster.\n\nThe DM can choose to prohibit arctic and desert druids from using this spell if they are not familiar with ivy.\n\nThe material component is an ivy leaf.\n\nNotes: Restricted to druids, uncommon."

They rush toward a chosen target creature at lightning speed, chasing if the creature dodges, and strike unerringly if the creature is within range at the end of the round. After delivering an energy-draining bite, the jaws vanish. This attack arrives at the very end of the round (thus, its damage does not disrupt spellcasting that takes less than a full round). The jaws inflict 2d8+2 points of damage. The creature must be visible to the caster during the entire casting time to be a valid target. A jaws of the wolf spell that fails to reach its chosen target fades away and is lost. The attack cannot strike the wrong creature, even if that creature switches positions precisely with the intended target. The target creature is allowed a saving throw vs. spell for half damage.\n\nThe material components for this spell are four wolf teeth.\n\nNotes: Granted by the god Silvanus, the Forest Father, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

Armor Class improves by 2, and 20% magic resistance, great physical strength, and dangerous physical attacks are gained. The greater segarran can strike once per round with a weapon (+6 bonus on damage from Strength bonus) or attack with a bite (3d6) and tail slap (2d10); the tail attack can affect up to three people simultaneously.\n\nThis spell is physically demanding; the caster must make a successful system shock roll to survive the transformation. The caster is compelled by the spell to devour fallen enemies in combat, a process usually taking 1-3 rounds depending upon the size of the slain foe. During this time, the priest cannot attack or cast spells. The caster can return to normal form at will, but this also requires a system shock roll. If the caster has not slain and devoured at least one creature, the chances of surviving the transformation back to normal form are decreased by 50% as a sign of Ragarra's displeasure.\n\nThe material components are the powdered scales of a giant crocodile, mixed with a potion of sanctified water, blood, and bitter herbs. The caster imbibes the foul brew upon completing the spell.\n\nNotes: Granted by the jungle god Ragarra of the Forgotten Realms setting."

        "Introduction": "A karma curse gives the caster a tangible guarantee that the affected being won't commit a breach of ethics against him or her. It has no effect on creatures of animal Intelligence or less, or on other entities devoid of ethical awareness.\n\nThe caster must decide, when casting the spell, which of these areas of ethics it will secure: truth, theft, murder, or the breaking of a promise. A being affected by a karma curse ensuring truth cannot lie to the caster without activating the penalty. If ensured against theft, the being likewise cannot steal from the caster. If ensured against murder, the being cannot murder the caster. If placed on a being that has made a promise to the caster, the being cannot break that promise without activating the penalty.\n\nA being who violates the curse conditions suffers an experience point loss of 100 points per round until stopping. If the action committed cannot be reversed, enough points to drop one experience level are lost. The curse still exists, however, and future losses of experience points are possible. While losing experience points, the being is aware of what is happening but perhaps not why, unless aware of the curse. Experience points can be regained only by performing un act of contrition equivalent – in the DM's judgment – to the act that resulted in the activation of the curse.\n\nThe caster is not required to tell the being about the enchantment, but must inform the being that he or she is expected to behave in a manner that will not activate the spell (example: “I expect you to keep your word, my friend”).\n\nA karma curse cannot be removed by a remove curse spells. Due to the personal nature of the spell, a karma curse cannot be cast for anyone but the caster.\n\nA karma curse can be cast only by non-evil priests. On Toril, only followers of the Padhran faith use this spell, though other deities may grant it to followers demonstrating a genuine need for its peculiar properties.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell, known only to a few eastern religions.

If Kelemvor's grace is conferred on a being other than the caster, the holy symbol must directly touch the recipient during casting.\n\nIn desperation, certain priests have cast the grace directly on undead beings (by touch, successful attack roll required) during battle and report that it lasts only to the end of the round following the touch in such situations. During this time, the undead are prevented from changing from corporeal to solid (or vice versa) and from using level draining or any other magical abilities. Undead capable of spellcasting (such as liches) can cast spells while under a grace, but such spells won't take effect until the grace expires.\n\nNotes: Granted by the god Kelemvor, Judge of the Damned, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

The amount transformed can be any volume of water no larger than the caster's head.\n\nImbibing even a single drop of laughing water banishes all weariness for a day, and exhausted creatures that drink it become alert and energetic. Swallowing a mouthful cures insanity, blindness, and disease and instantly destroys monster and animal internal parasites and their eggs. Moreover, the drinker is rendered immune to all of these perils for 24 hours from the moment of swallowing. A double amount of laughing water can be substituted for holy water in all uses and rituals of the Eldathyn and other good human faiths.\n\nThis water is named for another benefit. If laughing water is splashed on any being that is under or about to face Tasha's uncontrollable hideous laughter (2nd level wizard spell), it negates all effects of the spell instantly. A subject of such a spell who is carrying or comes into contact with laughing water (even just a few drops in a locket vial) before, as, or just after the spell is cast, is immune to the magic (it is consumed rendering this protection).\n\nIf hurled in a breakable container, a vial of laughing water inflicts 4d6 points of damage on any undead creature it strikes.\n\nThe material components are a pinch of diamond dust, a seed from any green plant that is less than a year old, and the water to be altered.\n\nNotes: Granted by Eldath the Green Goddess of the Forgotten Realms setting.

A guardian hammer strikes only once, but does not miss. When striking, it appears momentarily as a glowing, translucent hammer and then fades away into nothingness.

The being struck must make a saving throw vs. petrification to avoid being knocked down.\n\nA lesser guardian hammer can be destroyed before activation a successful dispel magic cast on the guarded area, or by totally destroying the guarded area without entering it (for example, by disintegration). The presence of an antimagic shell or its equivalent can suppress the ward, preventing activation. Once activated, a lesser guardian hammer bypasses all magical and physical barriers. It cannot be destroyed, reflected, or diverted by any means, although magic resistance functions normally.\n\nThe material components for this spell are a drop of sweat or spittle or a tear from the caster, a hair (from any creature), and a pebble.\n\nNotes: Granted by the dwarven god Thard Harr."

In any of its first three rounds of existence, even if it has been used as a handheld weapon already, a lightning lance can be used in one of the two additional ways described below. If used as a handheld weapon for all four rounds, in the last round the lightning lance strikes at +1 and for double damage (6d6).\n\nIf touched to a solid object and willed by the caster to discharge, the lance vanishes in a flash, forcing two item saving throws vs. lightning on the object; failure of either means the item shatters. If hurled by the caster (at the caster's THAC0 with a +1 attack bonus), the lance streaks away in a straight line and deals 6d6 points of damage to any single creature that it strikes. It fades away harmlessly if it does not strike anyone after traveling 30 yards. If the creature struck is in direct, physical contact with another being or beings, the damage is shared evenly.\n\nNotes: Granted by Talos the Destroyer of the Forgotten Realms setting.

The water is then used in the forging or creation of certain items to improve the quality of the goods. The lightning water removes imperfections, strengthens metal, and generally makes treated items superior in quality.\n\nMetal jewelry crafted with lightning water becomes one category more valuable (see the jewelry table in the DMG). All metal items, weapons, and armor crafted with lightning water have a +1 bonus to their item saving throws.\n\nTo prepare the water, a special trough or container made of fine wood inlaid with silver decorations must be constructed. The container must be made from materials worth no less than 5,000 gp. The container is then blessed by a dwarven priest. Thereafter, the container can be used any number of times to collect lightning water.\n\nThe water-filled container is first placed outdoors. The lightning water spell is then cast over the water, which is left out overnight to capture the spirit of the lightning from a nighttime thunder storm (either natural or summoned). If no storm occurs, the spell is wasted. Once the lightning spirit is captured within the water, the water itself is not electrified, nor is it dangerous to touch; instead, the water is simply infused with the magical potential and spiritual strength of the lightning.\n\nWhen the water is retrieved the next morning, it holds its lightning-spirit charge for 12 hours or until the water is used up in the smithy. The lightning water is used in the forging of weapons, armor, or metal goods, either to improve the quality of the items or to prepare them for magical enchantment. To treat items, 2 cubic feet of water is necessary for each piece of metal jewelry or other small item crafted, 6 cubic feet of water for each weapon, and 12 cubic feet of water for each suit of armor.\n\nThe material components for this spell are a miniature silver lightning rod worth at least 500 gp and a vial of holy water sprinkled into the trough of water to be ensorcelled.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell, restricted to dwarves.

        "Introduction": "A priest using a locate spirit animal spell learns the location of an animal that is the spiritual counterpart of an individual. For a full day afterward, the priest knows the current location of the animal. This spell is often used to capture an individual's spiritual counterpart, for both good and ill effects. A caster who wishes to inflict harm on the individual can often do so by injuring, or even killing, the animal counterpart. The subject of such an attack suffers symptoms identical to those of the animal (save that the person does not necessarily die if the animal dies), taking the same number of hit points damage as the animal counterpart. If the animal dies and the person does not, the hit point loss is permanent unless countered by at least a full wish. Each individual has only one spiritual counterpart and can be subjected to the spell only once.\n\nThis spell is often used for beneficial purposes when an individual suffers from a mysterious ailment. Often, the cause of the ailment is an injury or sickness affecting the spiritual counterpart. If the animal can be found and cured, the individual will recover from the mysterious ailment.\n\nJust because a priest knows the location of a spiritual counterpart that does not mean the animal can be reached. The animal may be anywhere within an area of 1d100 x 10 miles of the subject. Often, the priest must undertake a long journey in order to track down the animal.\n\nAn individual aware of the casting of this spell and unwilling to have the spiritual counterpart located is allowed a saving throw vs. spell. A successful saving throw means that the priest cannot find the animal counterpart, and the spell fails.\n\nOnce the animal is located, it usually regards any attempt to capture or injure it as hostile, even if performed for the benefit of its counterpart. It can fight as a normal member of its species in all ways. It is important to remember, however, that all magic and damage affecting the animal also affects the subject. In the case of spells, the human counterpart is allowed to make a separate saving throw, just as if the spell had been thrown directly against him or her, but with a -2 modifier.\n\nNotes: Common for priests from an Aztec culture. Optionally, available to other shamans and priests of primitive cultures.\n\nSpirit Animals: A spirit animal counterpart is most appropriate for characters from cultures that produce shamans, witch-doctors, and druids. The DM may rule that characters from other cultures do not have such counterparts. On the other hand, individuals who have personally adopted such an animal type as a totem or talisman, or have one as a family patron, may be vulnerable to this spell even if most other individuals of the culture are not."

It is known only to certain members of lizard deity cults and certain primitive shamans and witch-doctors. Except as noted here, it is virtually the same as that spell. The spell must be cast on a sizable log. For the duration of the spell, the log is replaced by a giant lizard with a number of Hit Dice equal to the level of the caster. Each Hit Die has a full 8 hit points. Thus, a 7th level caster turns a log into a 7 Hit Die giant lizard with 72 hit points. The lizard brought forth is a typical giant one, but its bite is poisonous; it inflicts 1d8 points of damage, and the creature bitten must also save vs. poison or die (onset time 2d8 rounds).\n\nThe reverse of this spell, lizard to log, besides reversing the effect of this spell, can change any nonmagical lizard like reptile into a log for the spell's duration, if a saving throw vs. spell is failed. If the Hit Dice of the lizard exceeds the level of the caster, the spell fails.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell."

If the system shock roll succeeds, the spell recipient (who may be the caster) takes no damage from the intense pain.

In theory, days of healing could bring the stricken being back to full health, but unless aid is nearby, or this “Loviatar's bane” occurs within a Loviatan religious community (whose members are sworn to care for the infirm, and heal them if at all possible), death is the likely result.\n\nThis spell has no effect on undead or creatures without nervous systems (such as plant beings, fungi, slimes, jellies, molds, and so on).\n\nThe material components are the caster's holy symbol and a drop of unholy water.\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil goddess Loviatar of the Forgotten Realms setting."

The spell does not alter Strength, Dexterity, or the like, but can temporarily increase or decrease Charisma (if the Dungeon Master permits). For example, if the caster alters his eyes to resemble those of an eagle or a creature whose eyes are on stalks, or modifies his feet to web his toes, others would obviously react to him differently than before the transformation.\n\nMultiple lure spells can affect a single creature at the same time. Lure spells end upon the death of the affected creature or when the magic expires. A lure spell can be removed sooner by a successful dispel magic spell.\n\nSome adventuring priests use this spell to temporarily gain beast powers or to change a single hand or limb for purposes of disguise, but most Sunites employ it to lure members of the opposite gender by increasing their personal comeliness (hence the name of the spell). When the caster employs this spell personally, no saving throw is necessary, but when it is cast to affect another creature, both the caster and the recipient must successfully save vs. spell or the spell fails and is wasted. If the recipient is unwilling, failure is automatic.\n\nThe material components are a drop of holy water and a scrap (of any size) of the caster's skin.\n\nNotes: Granted by Sune.

The round after it wraps around a subject and each round thereafter, as willed by the druid, the vine inflicts 1d4 points of constriction damage. Further, the subject must save vs. paralysis or be tangled. The first missed save gives the subject a -2 penalty on attacks and Armor Class; the second missed save immobilizes the subject completely. A successful bend bars attempt snaps the vine outright; a single blow of an edged weapon inflicting 5 or more points of damage severs it. Otherwise, it can withstand of 15 points of damage from edged weapons or damage-producing magic. The spell ends when the duration expires or when the vine is severed or destroyed.

The caster can affect an object of up to six cubic feet per level of experience; thus, a 7th level priest can affect an object 2x3x7 feet, about the size of a sarcophagus.\n\nMissiles subject to magnetic forces are attracted to the magnetized object and deflected from their intended course. A creature holding an affected item must make a successful saving throw vs. spell each round while in the area of effect, or the item is torn loose and pulled to the magnetized object. An individual wearing affected armor or similar accoutrements must make a saving throw vs. spell each round or be drawn to the object. The force exerted by the magnetic force at the source is 25 pounds per caster level – this can be used to determine if magnetically attracted objects can be separated by main strength (see “Maximum Press” on the Strength table in the PHB).\n\nThe foregoing assumes the magnetized object is either solidly fixed or more massive than the attracted object. If the object is lighter and not anchored, then it instead moves toward the largest mass of magnetically active material in the area and adheres to it. While the exact effect of this depends on the size of the object, a magnetized object adhering to a weapon may make it difficult or impossible to use, while one adhering to armor may hinder movement or other actions. Typical penalties range from -1 to -4. The reverse of this spell, demagnetize, can temporarily deactivate a source of magnetism up to 6 cubic feet in volume per caster level. Alternately, it\n\ncan render one iron or steel object of similar size nonmagnetic for the spell's duration.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell for priests with major access to the sphere of Elemental Earth."

If the recipient is affected by a successful deplete spell (for which the caster need make only a normal attack roll, without the -4 penalty) the maintain spell immediately ends, and the full time called for by the deplete spell is instantaneously applied to the Time of Loss and Change.\n\nSince cinnabryl is difficult to find in some places, priests developed a spell to counteract some of the effects of the Red Curse. After some work, wizards were able to duplicate the spell's effects.\n\nThis spell is used throughout the Savage Coast, but most commonly in Robrenn, Eusdria. Renardy, Bellayne, and Herath. In several small towns, the village priest or wizard makes rounds, casting the spell on all who need it. This holds off detrimental effects and keeps most of the common folk in those small towns from using Legacies.\n\nThe spell requires at least a week's worth of undepleted cinnabryl. This must be touched to the recipient's head at the end of casting, but is not consumed in the casting. The caster touches the target creature while reciting the verbal component to activate the spell.\n\nNotes: Common for priests from the Red Steel setting; otherwise, virtually unknown."

It creates a stronger barrier of force that cannot be broken through by a physical attack of any sort, including the use of such powerful weapons as a vorpal blade. The protection cannot be dispelled, but can be brought down by several spells: disintegrate, limited wish, or wish. Further, it can be destroyed by any casting of the following spells that causes at least 50 points of damage: fireball, lightning bolt, cone of cold, flame strike, Otiluke's freezing sphere, or meteor swarm. Creatures and objects in the area of effect when the ward is breached are not damaged by the breaching effect. The ward cannot be entered or left by traveling astrally, or by dimension door, passwall, or (deportation of any sort (including word of recall). Those in the hemisphere cannot cast spells out, though spells can be cast to affect those inside the area – cures, neutralize poison, commune, and so on.\n\nThe ward remains in effect as long as the caster is conscious; in the round after the caster falls asleep or is loses consciousness, the ward collapses. The caster can will the ward away at any time, but this act takes a full round.\n\nThe material components are seven gems of any sort (at least 250 gp value each). They are spaced evenly on the ground, around a 30-foot-diameter circle, though a smaller area can be warded if desired. The gems are consumed in the casting.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell.

The symbol varies according to the priest's religion and clan, marking one of the recipient's hands with the priest's clan insignia and the other hand with the symbol of the priest's deity. Once in place, the mark of brotherhood becomes invisible. Thereafter, only those who possess an identical mark of brotherhood are able to see it, magical detection notwithstanding.\n\nA mark of brotherhood is a permanent fixture unless the recipient commits some offense against the clan or religion associated with the spell, be it physical harm, political sabotage, or the like. If such an act is committed, the mark of brotherhood flares with the light of molten steel, searing the recipient's hands for 2 points of damage per level of the casting priest (at the time the spell was cast) and leaving behind visible scars from the ordeal. This damage is derived from pure divine energy; immunity to fire or heat provides no protection. Furthermore, while the inflicted damage can be healed, the scars are permanent, resisting spells like heal, regeneration, even a wish, and penetrating magical disguises including shapeshifting powers and illusions. Only after the subject has made amends for the offense (usually involving a quest on behalf of the offended party) can the scars be removed. In any case, the mark of brotherhood is negated if so triggered.\n\nThe purpose of this spell is to allow recipients to recognize one another and know who their friends are. It also serves to vindicate recipients who are falsely accused of some transgression against the clan or religion. If the charges are accurate, the defendant bears the scars as proof.\n\nThe material component is a special steel coin bearing the priest's clan insignia on one side and the symbol of the deity on the other. Still hot from the forge, this symbol is clasped between the palms of the recipient (inflicting 1d4 points of damage) as the spell is cast. While the coin appears to be absorbed into the recipient's flesh, it is actually consumed when the priest touches the subject.\n\nWhile this spell is typically reserved for dwarves, there is precedent for its bestowal upon other races who have performed some great service on behalf of the dwarves.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell, granted by dwarven gods.

The priest touches the central point of the area to be masked, and visualizes what appearance is desired (hue, fissures, shape, and general appearance). The spell cloaks the stone with the visualized, long-term illusion. A caster of at least 6th level can cloak a second section of similar dimension, and a caster of at least 9th level, a third section.\n\nFeatures of the stone under the maskstone spell remain physically unchanged. A known door can be felt for and located in 1d3 rounds. Unless it has been used by the searcher before, determining its method and direction of opening and the location of any locks or catches is extremely difficult without a dispel magic spell to end the cloaking effect. Only characters with thieving skills have the necessary expertise. These can find catches, locks, and traps on such doors at a -15% penalty to their find trap rolls; unlock locks at a -10% penalty to their open lock rolls; and remove found traps at a -10% penalty to their remove trap rolls.\n\nA dwarf, duergar, gnome, xorn, or other subterranean dweller can tell by examination that the stone's surface has been magically masked, but not the nature of the true surface. Features affixed to the stone's surface (such as maps or inscriptions) are hidden by this magic. True seeing penetrates the spell.\n\nThe material components are an eyelash (from any creature) and a pinch of dust or sand.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, reveal stone, negates maskstone. If not used for this purpose, it clearly indicates secret or hidden doors, panels, cavities. storage niches, catches, locks, and other deliberately hidden features by momentarily illuminating them with a glowing outline. These features are revealed if the stone has a maskstone spell on it or if it is simply in poorly-lit or confusing natural conditions.\n\nThe reverse of the spell requires a scrap of gauze and a piece of phosphorous or a handful of iron filings.\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil dwarven deity Abbathor."

He or she instantly becomes aware of the effects of any such magic present. The master rune spell prevents the glyph or symbol from discharging – even if the touch of the priest was its specific trigger. The priest can reduce the amount or extent of its damage or effects, but cannot increase the effect, or change its nature. The priest can also alter the conditions under which the symbol will discharge, in effect turning the symbol to obey his or her intentions rather than those of its creator.\n\nA less common use of the master rune spell is to cast it as a protection. Thereafter, when any symbol, rune, or glyph within the spell's range is activated, the caster becomes instantly aware of its effects and can divert them, even if the inscription's presence or location was previously unknown.\n\nMagical effects that change the state of creatures (such as petrification and polymorph magic, and enchantments causing an affliction) can be diverted to strike a nonliving target; for example, a wall, shield, or door. Magical attacks that directly harm (such as magic missiles, lightning bolts, and fire magic) must be diverted to a living target; for example, a hostile creature, or one better able to withstand the effect. The wielder of the master rune can reduce the effect of damage-causing dweomers to one-half normal (save for one-quarter). The diversion must occur within four rounds of the casting of the master rune, or it is lost. A master rune spell works only against the first symbol encountered; this expends its power.\n\nA Deneirrath priest's alignment precludes the diversion of glyph, rune, or symbol magic to an unwilling or unwitting creature that is not in some way threatening the caster. Magics diverted in contravention of alignment, or that cannot be properly diverted, are entirely channeled into the master rune wielder for their normal effect.\n\nNotes: Granted by the god Deneir, Lord of Glyphs, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

The meld allows the caster to see through the other being's eyes and read its thoughts, and communicate telepathically with the linked being.\n\nThe caster can act, speak, and cast spells normally without ending this link, and is able (whenever not casting another spell or using any psionic abilities) to dominate the linked being completely, controlling its body regardless of distance (the spell is broken if caster and linked being end up on different planes). The caster can use the linked being as the focus (source of emission) of a currently memorized spell, casting it through the linked being – but this ends the meld instantly.\n\nIf the linked being's Intelligence is less than the caster's, it is allowed a saving throw vs. spells once per turn to break the meld. If the linked being is as intelligent as the caster (or more so), and is or becomes (that is when ordered into danger) unwilling to be in the meld, it gets a saving throw vs. spell once every second round to escape.\n\nWhenever the linked being suffers damage, the caster must make a successful saving throw vs. death magic. Failure ends the spell, and the pain-wracked caster suffers 1d6 points of damage. If the linked being dies, the caster must make a successful system shock roll or die instantly (the caster can willingly end a meld 1 round after deciding to do so).\n\nNotes: Granted by the drow goddess Lolth."

An undischarged message mote cannot be magically detected or dispelled.\n\nOnce activated, a message mote manifests itself as a twinkling radiance (a single cloud of not more than 1 cubic foot in volume) of a hue, shape, and intensity chosen by the caster. It cannot be blinding or even equal to true sunlight, nor can its appearance change during its presentation, but it can mimic the features of a being or an item known to the caster. A message mote flies about on a route predetermined by the caster, at up to MV Fly 18 (B), within the stated spell range. If desired, its movements can convey meaning (for example, pointing out the location of a secret door, keyhole, or hiding place), it can also speak a message of up to 33 words in length. It cannot utter spells, words of activation, or any magical trigger phrases, but it does deliver messages in the voice of the caster, mirroring the volume at which they were delivered during casting. (The caster can, of course, assume an unnatural voice or employ mimicry, and the message mote will reproduce that, too.)\n\nNotes: Granted by the Tyr the Just God of the Forgotten Realms setting.

Any disturbance negates the process. If the subject makes a successful saving throw vs. spell, the spell is also broken (but a charmed subject is not allowed a saving throw). For the purposes of dispelling, the mindspin spell is treated as if cast by a 21st level priest.\n\nThe individual within the dream experiences it as three separate levels of reality. Parts of the dream are experienced as the dreamer moves over physical terrain. The terrain moves along at a rate of one mile per hour, with a maximum range that depends on the level of the dream and the subject's Intelligence. The first level maximum is 20 miles times the subject's Intelligence. The second/level maximum is 1-mile times the character's Intelligence. The third/level maximum extends to 20 feet times the subject's Intelligence. The dreamer is always a central figure of the dream; all of the effects of each level of the dream disappear if the dreamer is awakened. Dreamwraiths and dreamshadows are common in all levels of the dream; the character is constantly faced with determining what is reality and what is illusion.\n\nFirst Level: The first level of the dream alters a character's perceptions of space, time, and reality of the immediate area. What is seen as a lush forest may in reality be a barren field. A character may actually travel many miles, yet only perceive himself as having moved a short distance. Time is equally distorted. Travel seeming to last only for a few minutes may actually have taken several days.\n\nSecond Level: The second/level of the dream distorts a character's perception of reality even further, for he can no longer distinguish which of his companions are real and which are illusions.\n\nThird Level: The third/level is the core of the dream, as a character's perceptions of himself become distorted. In addition to the effects of the previous two levels, a character uses the attack and saving throw tables of another class:\n\nPriests use rogue tables\n\nWarriors use wizard tables\n\nWizards use warrior tables\n\nRogues use priest tables.\n\nAdditionally, because of the disorienting effects of the dream area, certain classes make the following adjustments:\n\nPriest: Subtract Wisdom from 20 and use the result as the priest's Wisdom for determining spell failure. Use the special Turning Undead table given here.\n\nRogue: For thieving skill rolls, all successes fail and all failures succeed. Otherwise, adjust the rolls normally.\n\nWizard: Wizards cast spells at one level higher than normal. If this enables a wizard to cast a spell higher than those he currently knows, he can choose any one spell from the higher level. The mindspin spell automatically gives the wizard the illusion that he knows this new spell; unlike other spells the wizard casts during the dream, this new spell has only illusionary effects.\n\nNotes: Rare priest spell from the Dragonlance setting (identical to the wizard spell of the same name)."

Contact can be broken or initially foiled by any thickness of lead, two or more inches of any metal other than lead, or two or more feet of rock.\n\nOne creature per round can be probed: the priest can freely switch from one being to another. The priest can even engage in spellcasting or activities requiring intense concentration without ending the spell – but any round in which the priest does not concentrate on the thoughts of a being is a round wasted. While the spell continues for the entire duration, without the caster's concentration, nothing is read.\n\nThe caster can use the spell to help determine if a creature lurks in ambush; even if no thoughts can be read, the priest can detect the presence of a mind, and gain some idea of its current state (agitated, active, damaged, at rest, and so on). Even a clear thought-reading will not always reveal what sort of creature is being read.\n\nThe material component is the priest's holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil drow goddess Lolth."

Further, it can be destroyed by any casting of the following spells that causes at least 20 points of damage: fireball, lightning bolt, cone of cold, flame strike. Otiluke's freezing sphere, or meteor swarm. Creatures and objects in the area of effect when the ward is breached are not damaged by the breaching effect. The ward cannot be entered or left by traveling astrally, or by dimension door, pass-wall, or teleportation of any sort. Those in the hemisphere cannot cast spells out, though spells can be cast to affect those inside the area – cures, neutralize poison, commune, and so on.\n\nThe ward remains in effect as long as the caster is conscious; in the round after the caster falls asleep or is loses consciousness, the ward collapses. The caster can will the ward away at any time, but this act takes a full round.\n\nThe material components are seven small pearls (at least 100 gp value each) spaced evenly on the ground in a 30-foot diameter circle. A smaller area can be warded if desired. The pearls are consumed in the casting.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell. (Updated from Dragon Magazine.)"

It functions only on a creature that has at least average Intelligence. When the spell is cast, the creature receives a saving throw vs. spell. If successful, the mirage of despair fails. Once a creature is affected, a second saving throw vs. paralyzation is required. Failure means it is terrified of the things it sees and flees as if affected by the 4th level wizard spell fear. A creature that is cornered or restrained will attack: it doesn't matter whether the other creature is friend or foe – all creatures are perceived as monstrous. Success means the creature suffers from increasing paranoia for the next turn, at which time another saving throw vs. paralyzation is made.\n\nCompanions who notice strange behavior from a friend can try to talk him or her out of the mirage (one chance), and this gives the subject one additional saving throw vs. spell to end the effect. A successful dispel magic spell or the reverse form can end the spell earlier.\n\nThe reverse of the spell, mirage of deception, makes everything seem beautiful, warm, and friendly. Athasian sloths are harmless woodland creatures, and an ancient enemy is suddenly friendly and trustworthy. As the subject becomes more trusting and gullible, he or she will agree to any reasonable requests for the duration of the\n\nspell. Requests of a dangerous or suicidal nature grant a second saving throw to break the spell immediately, and even if this is failed the creature's actions may be unpredictable.\n\nThe material component is the priest's holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for priests from the Dark Sun setting: otherwise, very rare."

In rare cases, the deity allows use of this spell to complete a fragmentary spell, but all priests of Oghma know that to overuse prayer and supplication in such matters, rather than applying research, contemplation, and experimentation, is frowned upon by the Most Wise.\n\nWhen a missing word spell is cast, the priest immediately suffers 2d6 points of damage (as if wounded; rest and healing magics can restore this lost vital energy) and is surrounded by an aura of purplish-white light and a tension in the air. The spell then either succeeds (the missing writing silently appears) or fails (the aura fades, and the priest receives a momentary and sometimes cryptic vision of guidance; no writing appears) as the god wills. (No saving throw governs this effect: the DM should decide Oghma's will in particular situations.)\n\nWhen the spell ends, the magically revealed portion fades, leaving the writing incomplete again unless someone has traced over the previously missing portions. At his discretion, Oghma can extend the duration of the revelation to allow the missing text to be copied if it would otherwise take longer than a turn. Using this spell to solve longstanding problems of knowledge, particularly to benefit others not of the Oghmanyte faith, usually succeeds. Using this spell to devise new spells or processes of making goods to enrich the caster generally fail.\n\nNotes: Granted by Oghma, Lord of Knowledge, in the Forgotten Realms setting."

A sentient being who views the priest must make a successful saving throw vs. spell (adjusted for Wisdom) to perceive the caster as he or she truly is. Failure means the being perceives the caster as someone else. The exact identity perceived is created by the affected being, but is one that is least likely to provoke an encounter or cause difficulty for the priest.\n\nCreatures of semi-intelligence or less (Intelligence 4 or less), supra-genius or better (Intelligence 19 or more) or with a Wisdom of 18 or higher are not affected by the spell. Creatures relying on senses such as scent to identify friends and foes and those who observe the priest casting the spell are not deceived by it.\n\nIf the caster is viewed by multiple creatures at once, the magic might create an impression that is the same for all or different for some, depending on which is least likely to provoke an encounter. The spell does not alter the caster in any way or create any visual illusion. While it does not ensure the caster remains undetected, it enhances the chance he or she is not. Each case is unique and adjudicated by the DM. The effects are not permanent. If an affected creature's attention is drawn back to the encounter after the spell expires, it will realize it's been duped, although its Intelligence and Wisdom determines the degree to which the creature can figure out what it really saw. Those with high ability scores will remember more or the truth than those with lower scores, while those with low scores (7 or less) may simply think that there was something odd.\n\nFor example, a priest casts this spell upon himself in order to infiltrate a camp of goblins and bugbears and rescue some prisoners. He appears unaffected to his companions who observed him casting the spell. If the priest walks past a bugbear guard, the bugbear might perceive him to be a goblin child who passes by its post several times every day to get water from a nearby stream. If the priest continues by a group of goblin warriors, they might perceive him as a particularly mean subchief who does not like to be disturbed. When the priest reaches the group of prisoners, they might perceive him as a cloaked figure resembling an ally who is obviously trying to free them while not raising an alarm.\n\nThe material components of this spell are the priest's holy symbol and small piece of thin, see-through material that is placed across the eyes.\n\nNotes: Granted by the gnome god Baravar Cloakshadow."

The bow can fire, at most, two arrows per round at any target within range. Each shaft trails a stream of motes of moonlight (as the 1st level spell, but lasting only 1d4+1 rounds) delineating the path of flight. A successful attack roll is required to hit the target. After any attack, whether it hits or misses. the arrow fired vanishes in a manner similar to the crystalline bow, as described above.\n\nThe effects of a successful hit vary according to the type of target. If shot into an area of magical darkness, the arrow negates the effect, but otherwise does nothing but trail the moles of moonlight. Against a living creature, a moonbow shaft acts as a bolt of energy from the Positive Material Plane, inflicting 7d4 points of damage. Against an undead creature that draws its power from the Negative Material Plane, the shaft inflicts 14d4 points of damage and bathes the target in silvery faerie fire for 1d4+1 rounds. (Multiple successful attacks against one undead creature do not increase the faerie fire effect, but simply extend the duration if a later hit would outlast an earlier one.)\n\nAgainst an undead creature that draws its power from the Positive Material Plane (such as a mummy), a moonbow shaft restores 7d4 points of damage, but has no other effect.\n\nThe material components are the priest's holy symbol and the silken thread of a cobweb coated in dew gathered beneath the light of a full moon.\n\nNotes: Granted by the elven goddess Sehanine Moonbow.

Beings of neutral alignment can also walk atop a moonbridge as long as they stay in direct physical contact with the caster (or form part of a chain, of which at least one member must be in physical contact with the priest). Evil beings find moonbridges as insubstantial as moonlight. In areas bathed in moonlight with no distinctive shafts of light, the caster can create a moonbridge from his or her location in any direction as long as the entire length of the moonbridge is bathed in moonlight without interruption.\n\nA moonbridge is at most 3 feet wide and at least 20 feet long, although it can extend as far as 120 yards, according to the caster's desire. It can last as long as one round per level, and the caster can order it out of existence instantly. The angle of inclination and direction of the moonbridge varies as noted above.\n\nThe material components of this spell are the priest's holy symbol and a vial of holy water that has been bathed in the light of the last full moon for at least six consecutive hours.\n\nNotes: Granted by the elven goddess Sehanine Moonbow."

A successful casting binds a supernatural spirit into a living human, demihuman, or humanoid body. A spirit that makes a successful saving throw vs. spell remains at liberty. If left in the body, the spirit can then attempt a saving throw vs. spell once each turn until it eventually escapes. If the body is not firmly tied down or otherwise incapacitated, the spirit can control it.\n\nUsually, as soon as the spirit is bound into the living body, the caster kills the body, flinging both the body's spirit and the bound spirit into the Astral Plane for the duration of the spell. When the spell ends, the spirit returns to the spirit world and the body's life force departs for its final resting place. Until then, the spirit can be summoned from the Astral Plane.\n\nExiled spirits are seldom amused by being abused in this way, and may attempt to avenge themselves against the caster when the spell ends. Similarly, other spirits may take offense at the shaman's behavior. Only the most evil or desperate of shamans will use this spell, as its consequences may be far worse than the circumstances that prompted the shaman to take the action.\n\nNotes: Restricted to shamans, uncommon."

        "Introduction": "This dramatic spell causes a construct that looks like a moss-covered skull to form in the caster's hand and fly from there to strike at a chosen target. The skull travels at MV Fly 21 (A), striking with a THAC0 of 9. The skull has AC 2 and hit points equal to the caster's level. It can be destroyed on the way to its target, but unless completely destroyed, it inflicts full damage if it reaches its target and hits. Touching a moss skull with either fire-based magic (not just heat) or ice-based magic (not just cold) destroys it instantly and harmlessly – it does not explode.\n\nA moss skull that strikes its target vanishes in a flash of light, sending forth both fire damage and ice damage into its target. Unless magically protected against those attack forms, a target creature suffers both kinds of damage, as follows: 4d4 points of fire damage (save vs. spell for half), followed by 4d4 points of ice damage (save vs. spell for half). Any item (such as a shield, helm, or breastplate) worn or held by a creature directly struck by the moss skull must make a successful saving throw vs. spell or be destroyed (other items will be unharmed, the target creature's body takes the damage instead).\n\nIf the moss skull misses, the caster can send it after a different target on the next round, but then it inflicts only half damage, strikes at THAC0 15, and is MV Fl 15 (B), with an AC of 5. When so directing it, the caster cannot engage in spellcasting on that round.\n\nA moss skull can strike the wrong person on the way to its intended target, but glances off without exploding or doing damage and continues to chase the target creature.\n\nThe caster of moss skull can will it out of existence at any time (even just before it hits). Otherwise, it fades away by itself at the end of the first round if it misses and is not immediately directed at another target by its caster. It fades away harmlessly if it misses its second attack.\n\nThe material components are a piece of human bone, a pinch of ash from something organic that has been burned in a fire of natural origin (lightning, for example, not caused by magic or deliberately set by a person), and a bone from a creature that froze to death.\n\nNotes: Granted by the god Silvanus, the Forest Father, of the Forgotten Realms setting.

        "Introduction": "This spell is a more powerful version of the detect metal and minerals spell. With this spell, a dwarven cleric can locate a major ore deposit of any metal or mineral. When the spell is cast, the type of deposit to be located must be specified. Only one type of deposit can be divined per casting of the spell. Furthermore, the material component employed in the spell must pertain to the type of deposit sought. For example, a tiny iron anvil is required to find the location of an iron ore deposit, while a diamond must be expended to locate a diamond mine.\n\nOnce the spell is cast, there is a 100% chance of finding the deposit if the deposit is within the area of effect of the spell. The DM must decide whether such a deposit is present. Obviously, the rarer the substance, the less chance there is of the deposit being present. A DM who wishes to leave the decision to chance can use the following percentages: 60% chance for finding a desired base metal, 30% chance for a precious metal ore or gemstone deposit, 5% for a very rare substance, and 5% for no substance whatsoever (adjust 20% in favor of the component type, but a 96-00 fails outright). The spell detects the desired deposit in a radius of 10 miles per level of the caster and to a depth of one-half mile per level.\n\nThe material components are the cleric's holy symbol and a small amount of the ore to be found. The cost of the material component must be comparable to the value of the deposit to be found. Typical material components will cost 1,000 gp for base metals, 5,000 gp for precious metals or gem-stones, or 10,000 gp for very rare metals such as mithral or adamantite.\n\nAny deposit located should be quite substantial, an amount sufficient to support the needs of a dwarven community for months or even years.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell, granted by dwarven deities. (Updated from Dragon Magazine.)\n\nAlternately, the DM can use the “Duration of a Mining Site” guidelines from the Dungeoneer's Survival Guide."

Placing the spell on a mobile creature or object creates a mobile effect.\n\nSahuagin can see 4d4 feel within the globe, while all other creatures can see 2d4 feet. The globe blankets all light sources within its area of effect, reducing their intensity to that of a firefly.\n\nLight or continual light spells cast on a creature's eyes cease to affect the creature while it remains within the globe. Other light-based attacks have a 50% chance to fail. If a light attack actually penetrates the globe's influence, all creatures receive a +4 bonus on their saving throws against the attack – even sahuagin. If the light attack fails, it remains briefly visible as a dim flash, like lightning flickering in the depths of a cloud.\n\nWhen cast above water, murk creates a rain of rancid slime mixed with thick fog that fills a 120-foot diameter globe. Watertight barriers block the effect, but the globe instantly expands to fill any open area. The globe extinguishes small fires – such as torches, candles, and cooking fires within its confines. Large fires and fire-based attacks have a 25% chance of failing. Permanent magical fires flare up again when the globe passes. Target creatures of a successful fire-based attack receive a +4 saving throw bonus against the attack while in the globe's area of effect. Surfaces touched by the globe remain coated with a film of slime and grit after the globe passes. A strong wind, bright sun, or desert heat reduces the spell's duration by half.\n\nThe material component is spittle.\n\nNotes: Restricted to sahuagin, uncommon for them."

This spell is effective in any lighting conditions, save near or total darkness.\n\nThe material components are the priest's holy symbol and the tear of a nymph that is placed on the tongue during the casting and vanishes upon completion.\n\nNotes: Granted by the elven goddess Hanali Celanil."

The creature must be able to understand the speech of the shukenja for the spell to have effect. The oath must be limited to actions that can be accomplished by the natural abilities of the creature and cannot directly cause harm to the creature or another. Thus, a shukenja could demand that a highwayman swear never to rob again, that an evil monster return to those deserted lands from which it came, or that a lord never overtax his peasants again. He could not demand that a monster commit suicide or force a samurai to attack an encampment of dangerous monsters. The DM must decide if any given oath is beyond the restrictions given. The subject is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effects of the spell. However, if the subject has been subdued in combat, the saving throw is made with a -2 penalty.\n\nOnce the spell is in effect, both sides have free will to abide by the conditions of the oath. If the shukenja (or any accompanying him) break the oath, the subject creature is instantly freed of it. (Whoever broke the oath suffers a loss of honor, too.) However, a subject who attempts to break the conditions of the oath is struck by wracking pains, causing the loss of 1 hit point per round until the creature relents or dies. An oath can be removed by the reverse of this spell, unbend, or by use of an atonement. A dispel magic spell cannot remove its effects.\n\nThe material component for both forms is the shukenja's holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Common for oriental priests; otherwise, very rare."

        "Introduction": "This spell is used to forecast the general fortunes of some major undertaking and determine auspicious and inauspicious events. When the spell is cast, the shukenja calls upon a deity to grant him some sign regarding the proposed action. Although the physical aspect of casting takes very little time, the shukenja must remain in one place and observe the natural events around him for the entire casting time. At the end of this time, he sees some omen – a flight of birds, the appearance of an animal, the fall of a leaf, and so on. that indicates the general fortunes of the undertaking planned.\n\nThis spell is commonly used before starting a journey, engaging in a major battle, or attempting some notable feat. The outcome of the spell is determined by two factors. First, the DM should consider the proposed action against information that only he knows. For example, the characters are about to leave a village to punish a group of bandits. The omen spell is cast to determine if this is an auspicious time to go. The DM knows that the village will be snacked by bandits that night, so the result would be an ill omen (since the characters would not encounter the bandits in the surrounding mountains). In situations where the DM has no information on which to base his judgment, 1d10 should be rolled and the Divination Results table consulted.\n\nHowever, omens are infrequent events, and interpreting them is difficult. Due to the strain this spell places on the caster, it can only be used once per week.\n\nNotes: Common for oriental priests; otherwise, very rare."

This response is always an obvious “yes” or “no,” though it is likely to be expressed in a symbolic way through a known sign of a power's approval or disapproval – seven swans flying overhead may mean “yes,” while a clap of thunder in an otherwise clear sky could mean “no.” If the request for an answer is not successful, no sign is obtained. (However, inexperienced or over anxious casters may well misinterpret unrelated events as divine answers.)\n\nThe material component is a gem of at least 100 gp value, sacrificed to the deity in the casting.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Mulhorandi deities of the Forgotten Realms setting."

A being in otherworld state is not affected by the energy draining and other special abilities of undead from the Negative Material Plane, but still takes physical damage from them when struck. Likewise, the affected being need not have magical weapons to hit these creatures. Those killed in the otherworld state have a 75% chance of being trapped in the Inner Planes and unable to pass to the Outer Planes (and thus cannot be raised, resurrected or reincarnated, but can be wished back). They often reappear as undead spirits of various sorts.\n\nThe otherworld spell can be cast only in the dark.

Whenever a creature other than the caster approaches within 100 feet of the ensorcelled document, a guardian is conjured forth from the script to attack the intruders. The spell can lay dormant for years until being triggered, after which the page guardian lasts for a number of days equal to the caster's level.\n\nThe guardian is normally a nondescript humanoid figure whose lower limbs fade off to wispy trails. However, if this spell is cast upon a page that features illustration, the guardian's appearance mimics that of the most prominent drawing.\n\nA page guardian adopts some of the dweomer from the writings from which it rises. Thus, it may possess special attacks and defenses depending upon the exact nature of the document. For example, a guardian that rises from a scroll of protection is invulnerable to the same force that the scroll would ward off. A guardian from a scroll of protection from swords suffers no damage from a long sword, no matter what its enchantment. A guardian from a spell-book can cast up to five random spells, launching each spell but once from the tome. The DM decides what abilities are received by the guardian should this spell be cast upon other magical books, such as those that increase ability scores or a manual of the golems.\n\nA common error among opponents of the guardian is that it can be damaged by the destruction of the source writing. This is untrue, because when the guardian rises, it automatically absorbs any enchantment upon the document: it erases clean that from which it springs.\n\nA page guardian attacks until all intruders within sight are slain. However, it does not leave the chamber in which its source writings are located. If no foes are left, the guardian slowly fades back into the writings that spawned it.\n\nThereafter, the magic fades away after a number of days equal to the caster's level, leaving the books unprotected but intact.\n\nThe material component is a special ink made from rare components that cost 500 gp. A virgin hawk feather must be used to draw the single sigil that the document bears as proof of this spell's dweomer.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell.

The webs are not disturbed or altered in any way by this spell or the passage through them.\n\nA creature affected by this spell can try to free creatures or objects already trapped in a web. This requires a successful saving throw vs. petrification, and a success ends the spell immediately. If a trapped being is unwilling to be freed and able to actively resist, failure is automatic.\n\nThis spell does not confer immunity to the effects of viscid globs (created by a wand of viscid globs).\n\nNotes: Very rare spell granted to the priests of drow gods."

        "Introduction": "This dangerous spell is based on the age-old belief that the world is just illusion and that mortals cannot comprehend it Penetrate cosmic ignorance allows a partial piercing of that veil. When cast the spell reveals the divine hands behind every creature and object present. The caster learns of subjects' patron deities, consecrated spaces, holy relics, spell residue, and extraplanar creatures. It tells every individual's level, every magical item's power, and every monster's special abilities among many other revelations. Wherever the hands of deities manipulate life – and they do so everywhere – the priest will know it.\n\nUsing this spell requires the caster to make a saving throw vs. breath weapon modified only by Wisdom bonuses. A caster who fails is driven insane by the revelation; if the priest is ever cured, the revelation is forgotten. Using this spell wipes all other spells from the caster's mind, and a full night's rest is required before spells can be regained.\n\nNotes: Common for priests from a vedic (Indian) setting; otherwise, very rare."

The smallest insect crawling on a leaf is seen in perfect detail; the sound of a fox's footfall can be heard clearly; with close concentration, the shaman can even hear the trees creak as they grow, or see each speck of dust on the breeze.\n\nWhile many solitary shamans cast this spell simply to enjoy the beauty of nature, it has innumerable practical benefits. Unless magically moving with no sound at all, no one can sneak up on the shaman (it counters Move Silently rolls). Tiny spy holes, minute clues, and traces are immediately obvious; a character with the Tracking proficiency, for example, can see all tracks with perfect clarity (though proficiency checks might still be required to identify them). Spotting needles in haystacks becomes a simple task.\n\nThe spell, however, has important limitations. First, it cannot be used to see through illusions. Second, it does not allow the caster to see through solid objects; walls, people, leaves, even blades of grass may obstruct vision. (Basically, if an object is within view, the caster can see it. The DM decides what is and is not in view.) Finally, it does not magnify sights or sounds more than 100 yards away.\n\nThe material component is an eagle or vulture's feather, which is not consumed when the spell is cast.\n\nNotes: Restricted to shamans, uncommon."

        "Introduction": "Like the 3rd level priest spell, lure, this magic changes a single feature (or matching pair of features) of the caster's body to match the equivalent feature of another living being the caster has personally seen. The change is actual, and the altered features perform as if the caster was entirely used to them. A permanent lure does not alter ability scores except for Charisma (if the DM so desires). Usually it increases beauty, but the spell may lower Charisma depending on how a feature is altered.\n\nOnly one permanent lure can affect a being at a given time; its presence causes any additional, lesser lure spells applied to the same creature to fail. Unlike the lure spell, a feature altered by a permanent lure must be natural to the recipient's race and gender. (That is, gills cannot be placed on humans, and males cannot be given a feminine form.) Permanent lure spells end if the subject dies or the magic expires, but they can be removed earlier by application of three successful dispel magic spells from the same source or caster or by a limited wish or wish spell. (These dispel magic spells need not be cast in swift succession; many powerful clergy receive two of them from an assistant immediately, and leave application of the third for emergencies, which may never arise, or that may occur a full year later.)\n\nLure spells cast on the bearer of an active permanent lure fail and are lost without any effect; a second permanent lure cast on an unwilling being who is already governed by one lure or a permanent lure is also wasted and without effect – but a being who willingly accepts a second permanent lure atop an operant one will discover that the two spells cancel each other out and cause the features they altered or were intended to alter to melt and run, twisting into unnatural shapes. The recipient suffers 1d4+2 points of damage and loses 1d3 points of Charisma. Time heals the lost hit points, but the disfigurement (and Charisma loss) can only be reversed by application of a cure light wounds spell or other magic.\n\nWhen the caster employs this spell personally, no saving throw is necessary, but when it is cast upon another, both caster and recipient must successfully save vs. spell or the spell fails and is wasted.\n\nThe material components are a vial of holy water, a clear, intact gem of any size and type worth at least 500 gp, and any size scrap of the caster's skin.\n\nNotes: Granted by Sune, Lady of Love, of the Forgotten Realms setting.

The pillar rises from a surface of earth, stone, sand, or clay, but not from any other substance. The height of the pillar is controlled by the caster, and can be raised or lowered at will (in the same manner as an elevator is controlled). The pillar can be controlled while the caster is atop the pillar or beside it, as long as the caster is within 30 feet of the pillar. The pillar can attain a height of 10 feet per level of the caster, and can rise or fall at the rate of 60 feet per round. The pillar's width is normally 10 feet in diameter, but this can be doubled to 20 feet by reducing the height by half. Altering the pillar's diameter in this way takes one round.\n\nThe pillar rises only vertically – not horizontally or diagonally. The pillar can break through flooring wood or roofing slate of no greater than 1 -inch thickness. Thus, the pillar can be used as a vertical battering ram against light, thin materials.\n\nThe pillar of Borogar can be used to create a small, temporary islet in a marsh or shallow pool of water, if the pillar can be raised from the ground below the water to reach the surface. The pillar begins, not from the upper level of the submerged ground, but from 10 feet lower, where the earth is more solid and not muddy.\n\nThe pillar can be destroyed by casting a transmute rock to mud spell at its earthen base, by a water elemental's attack, by precipitation equal in strength to a tropical storm, or by any other means that turns the pillar's earthen base to muck and mire.\n\nThe material component is a small cylinder made of earth or clay.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell granted by dwarven deities.

Creatures currently suffering from the plague cannot contract multiple cases of it, and those within range of more than one affected creature need only check once.\n\nWhen the spell effect expires, the creature is no longer infectious and the penalties end, except that lost hit points and ability scores take 1d6 days to return. Before the last of the plague's effects wear off, a final Constitution check must be made; if the creature rolls a natural 1 on a 1d20 roll, it dies.\n\nThe material component is a glass flask of rat viscera bathed in a small quantity of body fluids from plague victims.\n\nNotes: Granted by the Incabulos, god of evil sendings, of the Greyhawk setting."

This “luck” takes the form of an adjustment to an attack roll or a saving throw at some point in the future unknown to the subject.\n\nWhen the spell is cast, the DM makes two die rolls in secret. First, 1d6 is rolled to determine the exact effect. The caster learns only the general result of poor, fair, or good.\n\nSecond, a 1d12 roll determines when the portent result takes effect. The 1d12 roll represents the number of the attack roll (either by or against the subject) or saving throw made by subject that is affected by the portent. For example, if a 12 is rolled, then the 12th such roll receives the exact result as a modifier.\n\nSuch die rolls count only if they involve significant risk (that is, in combat or similar situations of consequence). The count is suspended if the subject connives, for example, to perform saving throws against nonharmful effects in an effort to manipulate the outcome of the portent. Die rolls that do apply toward this count include saving throws made in combat or against magical effects, attack rolls made by the subject, and attack rolls made by an opponent against the subject. The DM can count other rolls, such as proficiency checks or ability checks, in the face of danger. When the die roll designated by the portent is made, the result is adjusted upward or downward as indicated by the 1d6 roll. Thus, the subject is either more or less likely to score a hit, more or less likely to be hit, or more or less likely to succeed on a saving throw or similar check.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the effects of the portent do not extend beyond 24 hours after the casting. If the event has not occurred by that time, then it will not.\n\nThe material component is either a numbered wheel or tea leaves.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for clerics, divination specialists, and priests with access to the sphere of Chaos.

The priest has complete freedom in choosing the password, including the language in which it must be spoken. The password works only if it is spoken in the language the priest designates. The language does not need to be the native tongue of the spellcaster.\n\nA priest locked door or portal can be opened by breaking, or a successful knock or dispel magic spell, just as a wizard lock. The priest can negate the spell by speaking the password in reverse. This allows the priest to cast a new spell in order to change the password.\n\nThe caster must set a duration that the door, once opened, will remain unlocked, up to the caster's level in rounds. The priest can also place a time delay on the release of the door, which cannot exceed 10 rounds.\n\nFor example, a priest casts a priest lock spell on the door to her room. She specifies in the spell that the door will be released two rounds after the password has been spoken and the door will remain unlocked for five rounds after that. Her native language is Common, but her password is a phrase spoken in the Dwarven language.\n\nNotes: Rare priest spell, originally from the Greyhawk setting."

It creates a globe of protection, which protects all within from the direct attacks of one type of elemental creature. The sphere is centered on and mobile with the creature touched. If more elemental creatures attack than are protected against, the remaining ones can cross the barrier and attack. Forcing the protection against such creatures negates the protection. Otherwise, the effect of the spell varies with the caster's level.\n\nTwo factors rule the degree of protection. First, the total number of Hit Dice hedged out is 2 Hit Dice per level of the caster, to a maximum of 24 Hit Dice at 12th level.\n\nSecond, as the caster becomes more powerful, stronger elemental creatures can be hedged out. Thus, an 8th level caster can keep out elemental creatures with a total of 16 Hit Dice or less, as long as the creatures have less than 8 Hit Dice each.\n\nAt 7th level, creatures of a specific element with less than 8 Hit Dice can be hedged out.\n\nAt 9th level, the protection is extended to creatures of a specific element with less than 16 Hit Dice.\n\nAt 12th level, the protection is extended to creatures of a specific element with less than 24 Hit Dice. Further, the protection hedges out any type of elemental creature with 16 Hit Dice or less; thus, a 12th level priest who memorizes the air elemental version gains the ability to keep out earth elementals of 16 Hit Dice or less as well.\n\nAt 15th level, protection is extended to any elemental creature with 24 Hit Dice or less.\n\nElemental creatures with more Hit Dice, or exceeding the total Hit Dice limit, can pass the barrier. For example, if a 9th level priest's sphere is attacked by three 8 Hit Die elementals, one penetrates the barrier. A sphere attacked by a single 24 Hit Die elemental is penetrated as well. Note that attacks by elemental creatures based on their element are blocked, but other attacks might not be. Thus, while an efreet could not affect protected creatures with its wall of fire, it could shoot a bow, if it had one.\n\nThe material component is a piece of a substance that came from neither the Prime Material Plane nor any of the Elemental Planes.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for Elemental priests; otherwise, rare. Elemental priests are restricted to then-own elemental form until they achieve 12th level.\n\nOptional: Spells similar to protection from elementals can be researched for para-elemental and quasi-elemental creatures as well. It is suggested that, for a 12th level caster, 16 Hit Dice of any of these creatures can be hedged out, regardless of which spell the caster employs."

The after effects of weather – flood waters, muddy ground, or drifted sand, for instance – impede progress normally.\n\nThe recipient receives a saving throw bonus of +6 to magically created weather effects such as lightning bolt, wind wall, cone of cold, chain lightning, incendiary cloud, call lightning, and sunray, and a normal saving throw against magical weather spells that are normally listed as having none, such as wall of fog, fog cloud, gust of wind, ice storm, solid fog, death fog, control temperature, 10' radius, control weather, weather summoning, and control winds. The recipient can save vs. spells against a dust devil, success indicating it cannot attack him. As a side effect, spells such as whispering wind and wind walk cannot be cast or received by the recipient of this spell.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, intensify weather, subjects a creature to effects more severe than the actual weather would inflict. Driving wind or rain drastically slows the creature. Natural lightning inflicts double damage. A creature in the heat requires double the normal ration of water to avoid dehydration. I h e creature loses any possible save against magical weather spells, and those causing damage add one hit point per die inflicted. The creature gets a save to avoid the effects of this spell.\n\nThe material components for this spell are a small paper umbrella (or, for its reverse, a minute lighming rod).\n\nNotes: Uncommon for priests from the DARK SUN setting."

The spell does not alter the size or characteristics of the plant except as a function of normal growth. The rate of growth can be altered by up to one month for every two levels of the caster. Once cast, the plant continues to follow this cycle, regardless of weather or other conditions. Thus, cherry trees can be made to blossom in the dead of winter, plums can bear fruit months before they are normally ready, and so on. When first cast, the plant instantly goes through the various stages of growth until the desired point is reached. Thus, leaves sprout, buds appear, blossoms open, and fruit ripens before the eyes of all onlookers. Once the desired stage of growth is reached, the plant proceeds with normal growth thereafter, maintaining its new seasonal cycle.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, wither, causes plants and plantlike creatures to shrivel and die. For normal plants, this is automatic. However, plantlike creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. death to avoid the effect of the spell.\n\nThe focus for the both forms is the shukenja's staff, which is not harmed.\n\nNotes: Common for oriental priests; otherwise, very rare."

Once those creatures are engulfed in the cloud, they immediately flee the area in the manner of undead turned by a cleric. Intelligent insects like the thri-kreen may run before they are touched, once they see what's coming.\n\nThe cloud moves away from the caster at a speed of 10 feet per round, rolling along the surface of the ground. A moderate breeze can alter the cloud's course, but it won't move back toward its caster. A strong wind breaks it up within four rounds, and stronger winds keep the cloud from forming in the first place. Very thick vegetation disperses the cloud in two rounds, but the only place on Athas that qualifies as such terrain is the halflings' forest. The smoke does not sink as many vapors do (like a cloudkill spell); it also cannot penetrate liquids or be cast underwater – not a great concern on Athas.\n\nThe material component is a chunk of wood from the ranike tree.\n\nNotes: Common for priests from the Dark Sun setting."

        "Introduction": "By casting this spell, the shaman revives nature spirits, restores tainted water sources and barren soil to a wholesome and life-supporting state, and removes any magical curses and natural blights upon the land within the area of effect of the spell. Any nature spirits within the area of effect are treated as though they have just been subject to a revive spirit spell. On the other hand, any disease spirits in the area of effect must make a successful save vs. death magic or be destroyed. Disease spirits that are not slain must still flee the area, although they may return once the shaman's ritual is complete.\n\nAlthough the shaman must still have this spell granted by a spirit patron, this spell is too powerful for the spirit to power by itself. In fact, the shaman must sacrifice some of his own life energy to bring the land back to life, and it is this life energy that composes the material component of the spell.\n\nTo cast reinvigorate nature, the shaman must position himself at the center of the area, and cast perfect perception to become familiar with the immediate area and the blight that is affecting the land. Then, just as that spell is about to expire, the shaman launches into a 24-hour-long ritual that comprises the reinvigorate nature spell. During this time, the shaman decides how much life force to cede to Nature, and at the end of the period, it is then drained from the shaman and into the land.\n\n(In game terms, for every square mile of land the shaman wishes to reinvigorate, the shaman loses 1,000 XPs.) Halfway through the ritual, the character must make a Shamanic Ritual proficiency check. If the check is successful, the results of the shaman's efforts are visible immediately after the experience point drain has taken place: Grass, or some other appropriate plants begin to grow around the shaman's feet, spreading outward. Full recovery of the land may take weeks or months, but with the boost granted by the shaman's life energy, the recovery takes place in a speedy fashion. If the character fails the Shamanic Ritual check, no XPs are lost, and the ritual has no effect. After a day's rest, the shaman is free to try again.\n\nA shaman who is interrupted at any time during the ritual must start over. The shaman must wait a day and a night before trying again, just as if the Shamanic Ritual check failed.\n\nNotes: Restricted to shamans, uncommon.",
        "Karma Points": "Indian society is founded upon the concepts of dharma, karma, and reincarnation. Karma points affect future incarnations of a character from that culture. They are gained or lost depending on how exactly a character fulfills his or her dharma requirements. Each character receives 1 karma point per level, and up to an additional point per session (awarded by the DM for outstanding role-playing of dharma requirements or cleverly resolving conflicts between class and alignment dharma requirements). A character's dharma is determined by alignment and class. Both sets of tenets must be followed: significant violations of either cost a karma penalty of one point. Dual-class or multi-class characters follow the dharma requirements of all classes.\n\nClass dharma requirements are summarized here for vedic archetypes; the DM should define dharma requirements for nonstandard classes.\n\nWarrior: Warriors must be brave, never allowing fear to dictate their actions. They do not hide from danger or flee while a friend or ally fights on.\n\nRanger: In addition to warrior dharma, the ranger shows reverence to nature, never killing an animal or plant without reason.\n\nPaladin: In addition to warrior dharma, the paladin never tolerates evil, always helps the weak or poor, and is quick to give alms to beggars.\n\nWizard: Takes every obvious opportunity to learn about forces that shape the world or magic.\n\nSpecialist: In addition to wizard dharma, a specialist has one additional duty devised by the DM and related to his or her field of study.\n\nPriest: A priest is devoted to the worship of the god, never allows an insult to the faith to go unavenged, and tries to recruit followers whenever possible.\n\nSpecialty Priest: In addition to priest dharma, a specialty priest has an additional duty devised by the DM.\n\nDruid: The druid acts in ways complementary to nature, never killing an animal or plant without reason.\n\nRogue: The rogue accrues wealth, not leaving an obvious victim or inviting fortune untouched.\n\nThief: In addition to rogue dharma, the thief avoids brute strength, relying on cunning, stealth, or trickery.\n\nBard: A bard passes up no chance to tell others of things seen and tales heard, enlightens, entertains, and pursues knowledge in the form of tales and songs.",
        "Reincarnation Results": "Any continuing character transfers Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma to the new incarnation. Other abilities are rerolled unless otherwise specified.\n\nThe reincarnation appears within a day's time, having only vague memories of the previous life. All karma points are lost and the reincarnated character starts again at 0 points. U raise dead or similar is cast on the previous body before the reincarnation is complete, the process is halted, the old character can be revived, and karma is halved (round down). Once the reincarnation is complete, such spells cast on the previous body have no effect."

The spell can be cast on any ground short of solid rock, including sand, rocky sand or soil, or dust.\n\nIn either case, the spell affects the ground in a circle extending away from the caster, so he must stand in the middle of the area he wishes to revitalize. The radius of the circle is 5 feet per level of the caster. Once cast, the soil is enriched and moistened, and a layer of fine grass emerges instantly.\n\nThe duration of the spell varies. Once cast, the moist soil and grass are not magical, and are subject to all natural forces upon them. However, they will survive a week in even the worst of conditions.

The spell instantly restores all lost memories of the character. The second form of the spell restores limited knowledge to the character of previous lives. This use is more difficult and requires the recipient of the spell to make a successful saving throw vs. death to take effect. If successful, the character gains some limited memories of his previous life as a different person (or possibly even as an animal). The main use of this version is to gain information about events in the distant past. It may reveal reasons for the character's current fortunes, or information about places and items long since forgotten. This is used most often when the DM has created an adventure where such information is hidden from the characters. Thus, if the player characters discover an incomplete ancient legend describing some great treasure or past event, the remember spell can be used in an attempt to learn more information. The DM must decide if any useful information can be gained from this spell.\n\nThe spell requires a metal mirror, which is not destroyed.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, forget past, causes the victim to lose knowledge of recent events.

The victim is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect, although creatures subdued in combat receive no saving throw. Should the spell be successful, the creature repents of its evil action. This is either an action just committed or, if no recent action applies, some action committed in the past.\n\nThe remorseful creature forswears from committing this action again (with the same consequences as an oath spell) and also seeks to expiate its guilt through some appropriate deed or offering.\n\nThus, a highwayman struck with remorse would forswear such banditry and would seek to return his ill-gotten gains to the rightful owners. Likewise, an evil monster terrorizing the countryside would put this behavior behind it and might attempt to repair the damage it caused. When making restitution for its actions, the remorseful creature is not required to reveal itself (since this might result in harm to itself), but can do so secretly, concealing its presence and identity from those it has wronged. Should circumstances make restitution impossible, the creature can perform some service for another of appropriate magnitude to the evil deeds it has committed. No restitution can be for the gain or for the advantage of the shukenja or the player characters, but instead must be a service helpful to the general community. The shukenja can suggest appropriate restitution at the time of casting the spell, but the DM decides what is appropriate. An atonement spell can cancel the effects of remorse.\n\nThe material components for this spell are a pearl (which must be given freely to the creature) and the shukenja's holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Common for oriental priests; otherwise, very rare."

If the target is a purchased creature or a slave, the being suffers 3d8 points of damage; creatures of greater than animal Intelligence or more than 4 Hit Dice receive a saving throw vs. death magic to negate the spell.\n\nNotes: Granted by the jungle god Ragarra of the Forgotten Realms setting."

        "Introduction": "This spell permits a dwarven high priest to renew the normally nonrenewable mineral resources upon which dwarven society depends. With this spell, a depleted mineral or metal ore deposit can slowly grow and renew itself. First, a mineral “seed” must be prepared. The type of seed must be the same as that of the deposit to be renewed (e.g. a gold seed is used to renew a gold vein, a diamond seed is used to restore a diamond mine). The value of the seed ranges from 5,000 gp for a base metal (such as iron) up to 25,000 gp or more for a very rare substance (such as mithral or adamantite).\n\nNext, a circle of dwarven cleric's links together using a combine spell. The high priest casts prayer upon the seed, then casts the renew deposit spell with the circle linked again by combine. The seed is planted in the depleted vein at the midway point of the spellcasting. The clerics involved in the circle must then rest for 72 hours after the spell is completed, because the spell is so physically and spiritually draining.\n\nOnce the spell is cast, the depleted deposit slowly grows new ore until the vein is completely renewed. The vein renews itself at a rate that depends on the substance growing in the vein, as given in the list.\n\nThe substance grows until the deposit is fully renewed, up to the total volume of the original deposit. If the vein is again depleted, the spell can be cast again. If the vein is hastily mined before the deposit is fully renewed, the spell is broken and no additional growth occurs. Furthermore, no additional growth can ever occur, even if the spell is cast again, because the vein has been spiritually polluted by the greed and haste of the foolish miners. Only a special act of forgiveness by a dwarven deity can overcome the spiritual pollution of the area. There is no guarantee that this spell will be fully granted, even if properly performed.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell granted by dwarven deities. (Updated from Dragon Magazine.)"

The spell temporarily reverses penalties to ability scores due to aging, as detailed in the Player's Handbook. For example, a 250-year-old elf would temporarily receive a +3 bonus to Strength, a +2 bonus to Dexterity, and a +1 bonus to Constitution by this spell, but would not suffer a corresponding penalty to Intelligence or Wisdom. Willing recipients can forego the saving throw. The spell has no effect on dragons, extraplanar creatures, or conjured beings.\n\nWhile this spell does not ameliorate any damage suffered, it might increase the recipient's tolerance for pain. If a temporary boost in Constitution results in increased hit points (due to a modified hit point adjustment), those hit points are lost first, as with the 2nd level priest spell aid.\n\nThe material components are the priest's holy symbol and a freshly cut (or magically preserved) flower.\n\nThe reversed form, weight of years, temporarily ages the recipient. The priest must touch the target creature. A caster of 5th level can inflict the penalties of middle age if the target creature fails a saving throw vs. spell. A caster of 6th to 13th level can inflict the penalties of old age, and a 14th level or higher caster can inflict the penalties of venerable age. The caster can inflict the penalties of a lesser age if desired. The temporary aging cannot force a creature to die of old age, nor can it relieve the penalties of the creature's current age. It has no effect on dragons, extraplanar creatures, or conjured beings.\n\nThe material components are the priest's holy symbol and a crushed, dried flower petal or a shriveled, dried fruit.\n\nNotes: Granted by the elven deity Labelas Enoreth."

It can be cast only on items or assemblies of items that the caster is able to touch at least some part of, and that require only the addition of a single missing piece (of any size, from a pin-sized hinge to a castle door or portcullis). The caster must understand what is missing or broken and concentrate on the desired wholeness as the spell is cast, touching what is to be repaired and simultaneously holding next to his skin a clear or translucent gemstone crystal (natural, uncut) of any sort or value. The crystal is consumed as the spell takes effect, even if the repair attempt ends in failure. When a repair is attempted, the caster must make two saving throws vs. spell. If both fail, the spell has no effect. If both succeed, a permanent, “good as new” repair is crafted and the caster loses 2d4 hit points – damage that can be regained readily by healing or magical means. If only one saving throw succeeds, there is no hit point loss, but a temporary repair comes into being. The item must save vs. crushing blow 1 turn after the spell takes effect, and at the end of each turn thereafter – failure means the “repair” has broken. After 24 hours have passed all temporary repairs automatically break. Missing parts replaced by this spell break, but do not vanish.\n\nNotes: Granted by the god Gond, Lord of All Smiths, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

The caster can, of course, choose to do something else instead of using the repulsion attack.\n\nThe spell is not effective against drow or creatures of chaotic evil alignment – but other creatures are affected: The priest must be able to confront the creatures to be affected – see them and be seen.

        "Introduction": "By means of this spell, the shukenja is able to ask for some service or deed from a spirit. The shukenja must know the identity of the spirit before casting the spell and must be in the area the spirit occupies. The request must be within the powers of the spirit. The lesser nature spirit of a stream could be asked to change its course slightly or bring fish within it to a certain area, while the Lord of the Sea could be asked to summon a great storm, return some item from the depths, or ensure the smooth sailing of a vessel.\n\nIn all cases, the spirit is allowed a saving throw vs. spell. Success means the spirit need not honor the request. Likewise, if the request is outside the powers of the spirit, the spell fails. The DM can, under special circumstances, rule that the request is automatically followed, especially in cases where refusal would result in great harm to the spirit. The request must be carefully worded, for the spirit follows the literal wording, not the intent, of the statement. Asking for a great storm without specifying where and when won't give the desired results, for example. Furthermore, the spirit will try to harm to the caster (or place the caster under some obligation), usually by twisting the intent of the request, because the shukenja is bothering the spirit.\n\nCasting this spell is extremely taxing; when finished, the shukenja is mentally and physically drained. All spells currently memorized are forgotten and cannot be regained until the shukenja has had a complete week of rest. During this time, the shukenja can still travel but cannot take part in combat except to use magical items that do not require concentration or physical exertion. Furthermore, the shukenja's hit point total is reduced to I. Lost hit points can be regained thought cure spells (cast by someone else) or magical items.\n\nThe material component is an offering of appropriate value to the spirit, anywhere from 5 to 100 chi'en in value (25 gp to 500 gp). In addition, the offering must have some meaning to the spirit – usually a piece of art or an item of fine craftsmanship. Simple cash is seldom a sufficient offering. The DM decides the nature and value of the offering required.\n\nNotes: Common for oriental priests; otherwise, very rare."

By touching a creature, the casting priest uses his deity's power to erase the creature's bloodline. The victim is allowed a saving throw vs. death magic; if he fails, his bloodline and all blood abilities vanish permanently. Only a restore bloodline or wish spell can bring the bloodline back. Use of destroy bloodline is frowned upon in most parts of Cerilia; in some areas, it is banned entirely. Most scions feel that the spell wastes a rare resource; they would rather see bloodlines transferred or stolen than destroyed forever.\n\nThe material component for the reverse is a small sewing needle made of pure gold.\n\nNotes: Common for priests of Cerilia, the Birthright setting."

Large, simple writings and symbols can be readily read and understood by the caster. More complicated things (tiny or extensive writings, complicated diagrams, and all magical inscriptions or symbols) must be revealed by proper study.\n\nThe spell allows only one such element to be revealed, either a single symbol or a continuous line or series of lines of writing that were made by the same being and at the same time. The caster chooses this one clement and all of the other markings vanish as the chosen element becomes visible to all.\n\nIf the writing or symbol was magical and could be discharged by touching, passage, or reading, the caster can choose to restore it. The caster must then make three saving throws vs. spell. If the first succeeds, the restore rune spell restores the image of the original symbol and tells the caster its precise effects. If the second succeeds, the symbol fades from view again and communicates to the caster its conditions of activation (the caster cannot alter these, he is merely made aware of them). At this point the symbol is powerless. The caster can decide to end the spell at this time, leaving a symbol that can alarm or impress creatures, but has no other effect. If the third saving throw succeeds, the invisible symbol becomes charged. It has the same magical effects as its predecessor (except that the passage, presence, or actions of the caster of the restore rune spell do not activate it).\n\nThe material components are a pinch of powdered gemstone, a piece of chalk, and three twigs or stems from any sort of plant bound together with string, wire, hair, or vines to form a triangle.\n\nNotes: Granted by the god Deneir, Lord of Glyphs, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

Corpses inhabited by spirits (such as wights) and undead with more than 4 Hit Dice are allowed a saving throw vs. death magic, but zombies, skeletons and similar animated undead with 4 Hit Dice or less are not. The caster can affect 1 Hit Die of undead for each level of experience. Once cast, bits of the undead creatures begin to crumble and fall to the ground, completely destroying them in 3 rounds. As they deteriorate, affected undead creatures suffer a cumulative -1 to attack rolls each round after the spell has taken affect.\n\nThe material component is a pinch of dust.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for priests from the Dark Sun setting."

        "Introduction": "This complicated cooperative spell ritual allows its participants to cast spells into a prepared item or being; to transfer charges of magical energy from one item to another; or to infuse an item or being with powers from another magical item, altar, artifact, or other item of great power. The usual use of the ritual of transference is to infuse an item with magic. The spell is sometimes employed to empower devout lay worshipers with the means to help in a mission or defend a holy place, but it is only rarely used to imbue priests with spells beyond their capabilities. The only powers that can be transferred into a being are those that are spell like in nature; the ability of say, a rod of lordly might to change into a climbing pole or a magical weapon could not be transferred.\n\nThe caster must have touched the destination being or item (or one of its component parts) or at least one of the donor sources of magic at some time in the past, but no contact with them is necessary during casting. A droning chant is begun and must continue unbroken for the entire turn of casting, though the initial caster can cease to chant without ruining the spell if other participants are chanting.\n\nOnce a ritual of transference is begun, other priests can participate by casting their own ritual of transference or a combine spell and touching the caster of the original spell with their bare flesh. Once the turn-long casting of a ritual is complete, the spell lasts for another turn, and it is during this time that participants can cast spells of their own into the item or being. If a participant casts a spell at the wrong item or being (in other words, not the spell's designated recipient), the spell takes its normal effect, and the mistaken (or hostile) participant's involvement with the ritual is broken. Note that the ritual lasts for 1 turn following the initial turn of casting; additional participants do not extend its length by the casting of their own ritual spells.\n\nAny number of spells or charges can enter the recipient item or person during the same round without causing harm or affecting each other, but all spells take their normal casting times. Charge transference is one charge per level of the transferring priest per round. Magical item effects take 1 round each to transfer.\n\nAs each spell, set of charges, or magical item effect enters the recipient being or item, a saving throw is made by the recipient being or item. If the recipient is a creature, a saving throw vs. spell is required; each success allows the spell or magical effect to enter the being. A failure dissipates the magic effect instead of transferring it. Spells and effects do not affect a being as if they had been cast at it or used on it, but become magic stored within the recipient under his or her mental control in addition to any memorized spells or natural spell-like powers the being possesses.\n\nIf the recipient of the ritual of transference is an item, its base saving throw is a 12. Each time that saving throw succeeds, the transferred spell, magical item effect, or set of charges successfully enters the item. Each time the saving throw fails, the magic dissipates and is lost. Spells and effects do not affect an item as if they had been cast at it or used on it, but become magic stored within the recipient item that is used to imbue it with certain powers.\n\nBoth creature and item saving throws are cumulatively modified as follows: +2 per priest other than the initial caster that participates in the ritual; +1 if the recipient item or being is in or on an altar or other sacred spot or object; -1 for a spell or magical charge transferred into the recipient by a being other than the initial caster; -1 per priest participating who does not serve the same deity as the initial caster; -2 if any hostile magic is cast into the recipient or so as to affect any participating priest during the ritual of transference; and -5 per participant who is slain or deliberately wounded during the casting. Since repeated saving throws are made, events that occur during the ritual's duration only affect saving throws made after they occur. The ritual does not protect its participants in any way.\n\nBeings who have had spells or magical item abilities transferred into them can use these stored magics in one of two ways: They can unleash them by silent act of will as the same spells or abilities they absorbed or they can absorb them as healing energy, transforming a stored magic into a curative effect upon themselves. Only one spell can be unleashed during a round, but any number of curative effects can be performed instantly during a round and can even be combined with a stored spell unleashing or the recipient being's normal actions for a round. Unleashed spells require no casting time, components, or skill at wielding magic, and their unleashed effects perform as if they were wielded by their original source caster or item. Curative energy gained is 1d4 points of healing for every spell level used up; a partially transformed spell cannot be cast forth, and extra points of healing gained above damage taken by the being are lost and wasted. Stored spells or magical item abilities remain until they are used by the spell recipient.\n\nThe material components are two properly consecrated holy symbols: the priest's own and another dedicated to the same deity that is consumed during the casting.\n\nNotes: Rare spell of the Forgotten Realms setting, recorded by Volo."

The presence of cover or armor does not automatically lessen damage due to the unpredictability of ricochets, bounces, and the like.\n\nThe shrapnel does a base damage of 1d4+1 points per level of the caster (i.e. 1d4+1 points per cubic foot of rock).

The drinker regains 1d2 lost Strength points and 1d4 lost hit points by quaffing the entire output of a single rosewater spell. It also banishes weariness for 1d4 days, making the imbiber as alert and refreshed as if he had just awakened from a good long sleep. (This does not substitute for a spell-caster's need to sleep before memorizing spells.)\n\nIf consumed by those of other good and neutral alignments and faiths, rosewater acts simply as pure water. To any evil creature, it still tastes good, but is a corrosive drink that inflicts 1 point of damage from a single drop, 1d6+1 points from a swig, and 3d4 points of damage if the entire amount is quaffed.

        "Introduction": "This spell is used to strengthen the fortifications of a dwarven stronghold by increasing the resistance of a castle wall, gate, portcullis, drawbridge, or other defensive structure against physical or magical attack. The spell is cast by a circle of dwarven clerics linked by a combine spell. Next, a large rune is inscribed on the surface of the structure to be protected in the last turn of the spellcasting. The rune is created to protect a surface of up to 2,500 square feet in area (such as a 50-foot by 50-foot section of castle wall). The rune is invisible after the spell is cast, but can be revealed by a detect magic spell.\n\nThe protection provided by the rune is not permanent: it expires after one month, and the rune fades away if the spell is not renewed. To renew the rune's power, a dwarven cleric of at least 7th level experience must cast a glyph of warding spell upon the rune before it fades; the rune is thus renewed and remains in effect for another month. The dwarves must constantly renew the runes protecting a stronghold every month on a regular schedule, or else the runes fade away and become useless.\n\nThis powerful rune protects a surface from the attacks of battering rams, siege machines, stones hurled by catapults or giants, ballistae missiles, or other such physical attacks that inflict structural damage. All physical attacks inflict no damage to the surface. A section of castle wall or stone tower protected by this rune cannot be undermined and collapsed by sappers, because the rune maintains the strength and integrity of the structure and its underlying foundation.\n\nThis rune also provides protection from many magical attacks. An attack that inflicts structural damage, such as a lightning holt, disintegrate spell, or a horn of blasting inflicts only half damage if a successful saving throw vs. spell is made. The saving throw made by the structure is that used by a 19th level or greater cleric. Thus, if an earthquake spell strikes a structure protected by this rune, the earthquake's damage is reduced by 50% if a saving throw of 7 or better is rolled. Also, if a saving throw vs. spell is made against a passwall spell, the passwall does not take effect.\n\nThis rune has one additional protective function. If a prayer spell is cast upon the rune by a dwarven cleric, any structural damage suffered by the protected structure repairs itself at the rate of two points of damage per round. The repair continues for as long as the prayer spell is in effect.\n\nIt is possible for the rune to be destroyed or dispelled, of course. If the surface upon which the rune is inscribed is utterly destroyed, the rune is also destroyed, and no repair can take place if a prayer spell is cast upon the rune. A section of castle wall reduced to rubble or a drawbridge smashed apart also loses its protective rune. A dispel magic spell cast by a high level spellcaster might possibly dispel the rune. Again, the rune is treated as if cast by a 19th level or greater cleric.\n\nThe material components for this spell are a golden writing stylus with a diamond point (worth at least 5,000 gp), which is used to"

        "Introduction": "This special type of magical inscription, more powerful than a glyph of warding but less powerful than most symbols, was once the heart of ancient dwarven magic, usable by all dwarves (with differing degrees of power and reliability – modern dwarves do not have this power). Adventurers who have explored some of the remotest northern and southern depths and mountain-caverns report that either there are dwarven monasteries (clerical communities) or that a few dwarven clans or bands retain the use of rune magic.\n\nRunes of power as used by dwarven clerics throughout the Realms are described here. They increase in power according to the level of the dwarf casting them. A successful saving throw vs. spell enables a creature violating a rune of power to escape its effects.\n\nThe priest casting the rune sets the exemption conditions; that is, the situations or creatures that won't cause the rune of power to operate. Otherwise, any being passing, entering, or opening the surface on which the rune of power is inscribed suffers its harmful effects. Touching or attacking the rune of power itself also activates it.\n\nA rune of power can be set to avoid discharging when creatures of certain races, alignments, faiths, and sizes try to pass it. It cannot be set to avoid specific levels. Hit Dice, or classes of creatures, and cannot be combined with other runes, glyphs, or symbols.\n\nRunes of power can be drawn to any size larger than the caster's hand, and their trigger lines can be extended to encompass any size of protected area on a single surface. Dispel magic spells can remove runes of power.\n\nMost runes of power duplicate or resemble the effects of wizard spells. The most widely-known of these killing runes of power are:\n * Alhalbrin: This rune of power melts metal on all metal items that contact or pass it, within 3 rounds of its activation. The metal receives a saving throw vs. magical fire (with a penalty of -3 if not elven chain or magical in nature). Whether the metal melts or not, it grows hot, doing any being in contact with it 1d4 points of damage.\n * Faerindyl: This rune of power causes a flaming sphere to come into being out of the protected surface. The flaming sphere rolls directly away from the protected surface with a movement of 18. It passes around all immovable objects in its path, bursting only when it contacts a wall or other surface larger than its own 10-foot radius. Creatures within 5 feet of the sphere must save vs. spell or suffer 1d4 points of heat damage. Beings struck by the spell must save or take 2d4 points of fire damage. Objects in contact with the sphere must save vs. magical fire. When the sphere bursts, all creatures within 10 feet must save vs. spell or take 3d6 fire damage. The flaming sphere is quite different in behavior and effects from the wizard spell of the same name. The only known way to stop a flaming sphere is with a wall of fire (with which it merges), a wall of force (which causes it to burst), or a dispel magic. Otherwise, it flows around and through all obstacles, including creatures in its path.\n * Sabras: This rune of power creates a miniature blade barrier effect, across (and in line with) the protected surface on which the rune of power was inscribed. It lasts for only one round, but does 4d6 damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the protected surface (a successful save vs. spells allows a Dexterity check; if successful. the being escapes with no damage; if failed, the creature takes only 2d6 damage).\n * Thimdaril: This forceful rune of power acts as a polymorph other spell on creatures activating it. Unlike the wizard spell of the same name. Intelligence retention and system shock survival are automatic. Otherwise (equipment, class skills, and the like) the change functions as the wizard spell. The priest casting the rune sets the form to be changed into; Elminster reports that dwarven priests seem to like populating guarded areas with snails, slugs, and toads.\n * Velurndyn: This rune of power acts as a reverse gravity spell, flinging all beings within 20 feet of it (when activated) upward for 30 feet, and then immediately back downward. Creatures unable to fly suffer 3d6 failing damage, plus 3d6 (or less, if the ceiling is lower) impact damage for striking the ceiling, provided the ceiling is within 30 feet of the floor, in some cases, stalactites, piercer monsters, or even artificial spikes have been set into ceilings to augment such a trap.\n\nSome runes of power are named by the caster as they are inscribed, and take immediate effect.\n\nThe most widely-known of these fast runes are:\n * Bhelaerak: Acts as the 8th level wizard spell glassteel, affecting 10 pounds of weight per level of the priest.\n * Corsimmyr: Acts as the 5th level wizard spell passwall.\n * Delhaubrin: Acts as the 2nd level wizard spell shatter.\n * Elemsyr: Acts as the 2nd level wizard spell invisibility, affecting a single living or nonliving body or object. If an invisible creature launches a successful attack, it immediately becomes visible.\n\nThe material component to create any rune of power is the priest's holy symbol, which is used to trace the rune.\n\nThe Lost Runes of Power: Legends persist of runes once known to the dwarves that were far more powerful than the existing ones. A single rune of power was used to level the ancient city of Dharrmaghongh in Murghom, long ago. Elminster warns that although such runes definitely existed, no dwarven clan controls such power now – or recent dwarven history would be far different.\n\nNotes: Very rare dwarven magic of the Forgotten Realms setting."

Though it receives no attack bonuses, is considered a +2 magical weapon when determining what it can hit.\n\nA sacred strike whip is always silent. Any living being successfully struck must save vs. spell and make a Constitution ability check. If both succeed, the victim suffers only 1 point of damage, and enough pain to force a -1 penalty on the first attack roll (or ability check roll, if forced prior to an attack) during the next round. (If the victim makes neither during that round, the pain passes without additional effect.)\n\nIf the saving throw fails, the victim takes 4d4 points of damage, and the caster gains half the points as healing energy. (If the caster is not wounded at the time, no extra hit points are added, nor can they be saved to offset damage that may occur in future rounds.)\n\nIf the ability check fails, the victim is wracked with pain for the rest of the round and the entire subsequent round.

It cannot be chosen by the caster of the sacrosanct, but it is viewed by everyone in the protected area, all of whom also receive a general idea of its distance and direction – as the redirected being reaches it.

Although it will be a solid piece of the type of stone used as a material component, its color, apparent type of stone, and apparent age (from new and gleaming to ancient and crumbling) are as visualized by the caster during casting.\n\nA sanctified marker is a solid object and can be climbed. One spell can be cast atop another to create a larger (or longer, if placed horizontally as a bridge) stone “needle.” If there is no solid ground present where the spell is cast, the marker will float in midair. (The magic holds it aloft, but it does possess the normal weight of solid stone.)\n\nA sanctified marker can be blank, or it can bear one symbol, or it can bear one symbol and an inscription (whichever the caster desires at the time of casting). The symbol cannot be part of a spell, and the marker will absolutely not accept the later application of any glyph, symbol, or rune magic cast upon it. The symbol can be a directional arrow or even a crude map, and can be a holy symbol (although this becomes simply a design, lacking the magical powers of a priest's consecrated holy symbol).\n\nThe marker inscription, if one is desired, must be in a tongue the caster can read, and its maximum length is one word per level of the caster. It may contain words of magical activation, but cannot be a written spell or enchanted writing that unleashes a magical effect when it is read. Once the inscription is chosen and the marker created, it will never accept additions or alterations to its inscription, though additional writings can be added by purely physical means (chiseled or painted, without benefit of magical materials or force).\n\nA sanctified marker can be instructed during casting to explode if any spell or magical item is cast or used on it after its creation. If it does so, the result is a spherical blast with a 40-foot radius that completely destroys the marker, hurls tiny fragments out with terrific force in all directions as they vaporize, leaves nothing but drifting smoke, and deals all creatures within the blast radius 4d4 points of damage (save vs. spell for half damage). A marker must be solid, without internal cavities or foreign materials embedded or concealed in it, although there are rumors of more powerful variants that allow keys, magical items, and the like to be concealed within a marker.\n\nThe material components are three drops of holy water and a lump of any sort of stone the size of the caster's palm.\n\nNotes: Granted by the god Deneir, Lord of Glyphs, of the Forgotten Realms setting."

The amount of aging that can be so reversed depends upon the level of the caster. Consult the table for the average effects of time and the elements on various materials (items protected from the elements might take longer to\n\nerode, but use these times for all restoration). Papyrus and wooden objects fade over time, making it difficult, but not impossible, to read or identify surface features. Fragile objects must survive an item saving throw vs. fall every time they are used; brittle items must survive vs. crushing blow. Crumbled items are unusable but still identifiable as papyrus or wood; dust is completely unidentifiable and unusable.\n\nStone and metal items wear away over time, and their shapes smooth out until the item is completely worn away. Paint indicates that artificial coloration is gone or unrecognizable; Etching means carved letters or pictures are worn away; Relief indicates that deeply carved letters or images are severely eroded; Form indicates that time has eroded away all but the basic form of the original stone or metal. The fractions 1/2 and 1/2 tell when the item has lost that amount of its original mass. Dust means the original item is completely gone, eroded away to nothing.\n\nA 15th level priest could, for example, turn even a pile of dust back into the new, clean piece of papyrus it once was, or turn the crumbled remains of a staff back to its original form, or even restore a painted map on the wall of a temple constructed of soft stone. This spell cannot restore damage done to an object by anything other than natural aging or erosion. Use this table as a guide for other objects that don't exactly fit into these categories.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, accelerate erosion, allows the priest to speed up erosion on any nonliving material object. In the example above, the 15th level priest could turn a clean piece of papyrus to dust, or turn a new staff of wood into crumbled pieces, or erase a painted map from a wall of soft stone.\n\nThe material components for this spell are a tiny hourglass (during the spell, the sands run upward) or, for the reverse, a miniature sundial that has timed the passage of at least one year. Neither is consumed in the casting.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for priests from the Dark Sun setting; otherwise, very rare."

        "Introduction": "This spell creates a roaring rush of air, drawn from some undefined elsewhere and emitted from the caster's mouth. When active, it is in a cylindrical shape as tall as the caster and extending to the limits of its spell range that is of short duration and centered on one target, such as a specific being or a spot such as a doorway, window, throne, or hallway. This magical force can whirl away dust, vapors, leaves, papers, and the like in the same manner as a magical gust of wind, but has no effect on living creatures. A scouring wind can have one of three effects, chosen by the caster (once made. the choice cannot be altered): destroy barrier, destroy armor, or augment missiles.\n\nWhen used against any magical barrier created by a 5th level or lesser spell, a scouring wind automatically destroys the barrier. Against barriers of higher levels, it has an 8 in 10 chance of destroying them, minus 1 point for each level they are above 5th. (Thus, it has a 7 in 10 chance of destroying an antimagic shell or a wall of thorns, and a 4 in 10 chance of destroying a prismatic sphere.)\n\nWhen a scouring wind is used against any form of enchanted armor (including shields) or clothing. the armor must make an item saving throw vs. disintegration with a bonus equal to the item's enchantment level (its “plus”). Success means the item is unaffected: failure means its magic ceases to function for five full days. When nonmagical armor or clothing is scoured, it must save vs. spell or be entirely torn away and disintegrated. Living things (such as peltasts) worn as protective garb are entirely unaffected by a scouring wind.\n\nWhen a scouring wind is used to augment missiles, they must be launched or introduced into it. If of a smaller volume and mass than the caster's head, they are hurled away by this spell and strike for triple damage at +3 above the caster's THAC0 (not that of the launcher, if a different person). If larger, they fall out of the wind. Any number of missiles (from the traditional arrows, sling stones, and darts to spears or even clubs and other hand weapons) can be hurled in this manner, so long as they can be put into the path of the wind. A scouring wind directed to augment missiles that sweeps them into a barrier pulverizes them and does not shatter the barrier or permit them to fly onward.\n\nA scouring wind can also be commanded to negate a natural wind or magical gust of wind. If so employed, the scouring wind negates the latter completely and creates an area of calm 100 yards in diameter for 1d4+1 rounds when used against a natural wind (even over tornadoes, gales, or hurricane-force storms).\n\nNotes: Granted by Talos the Destroyer of the Forgotten Realms setting.

Even sharks may respond and, for the duration, their natural predatory urges will be kept in check. The summoned creature can bear one person at the surface of the waves, and can carry the rider a variable distance depending on its reaction to the summons (see below).\n\nWhen the spell is cast, the sea priest must picture where he or she wants the creature to go. Since this spell does not bestow the ability to communicate with sea creatures, only the mental picture provides direction to the sea mount. The DM should make a reaction roll: if friendly, the creature carries its rider to the nearest shore, no matter how distant. If unfriendly, it travels to somewhere near and abandons its rider as soon as possible. A creature that makes its saving throw can either ignore the summons, or deliver the rider to a destination of its own choosing.\n\nNotes: Common for sea priests, otherwise very rare.

This spell fails if any party is an unwilling participant, is under the effects of a charm spell (or similar effect), or is not in his or her right mind, as adjudicated by the DM.\n\nIf any party fails to meet the terms of the successfully cast seal of Cyrrollalee due to factors beyond his or her control and despite his or her best efforts, the oathbreaker suffers the effects of a curse spell (as the reverse of the 1st level priest spell bless) until such time as he or she receives an atonement spell cast by a priest Cyrrollalee.\n\nIf any party deliberately fails to meet the terms of the oath, Cyrrollalee's wrath affects the oath-breaker by reducing one ability score to 3 (the DM randomly determines which ability score).

If the book is actually 3.000 miles away, the priest gains only a one-round vision and an impression of the country or kingdom in which it lies.\n\nIf the priest is not personally familiar with the thing sought, the results are one step worse than normal. Spells or items that defeat scrying or detection are effective against seek and may confuse or block the results.\n\nThe material component is a small, precious crystal, worth at least 500 gp.\n\nNotes: Common for priests with a specialty in Divination; otherwise, barred.\n\nOptional: A priest who uses the seek spell to locate a thing protected against scrying can penetrate the protection, if holding some physical object closely related to it; for example, a lock of hair from an individual, a pinch of dirt from a location, a scabbard that held a weapon, and so on Breaching such protections ages the caster 1 to 5 years, depending on the strength of the protective magic. The priest knows the exact cost and can abandon the spell if desired Artifacts and relics can be located, but these always age the caster.

Although it does not possess any magical plusses (+1, and so on), it does radiate magic. Because of its composition, it is nearly weightless, with an encumbrance value equal to normal clothing. It prevents magic missile and similar spells from damaging the wearer, completely negating them. Segojan's armor acts as actual armor, so magical items like bracers of defense and spells like armor cannot be used with it\n\nWhen the spell expires, the armor immediately unravels into its component parts. A successful dispel magic or similar effect ends the spell immediately.\n\nBefore casting this spell, the priest gathers an armload of grass and roots, and places the material in a pile. Next, an ounce of powdered iron is sprinkled over the collected foliage, and the spell is cast. As the incantation is uttered, the roots and grass weave themselves into a suit of armor tailored specifically to the caster, other beings cannot wear it. The caster's holy symbol is required during the casting. Only the iron powder is consumed in the casting.\n\nNotes: Granted by the gnome god Segojan Earthcaller."

Furthermore, the hammer to be affected must be owned and used by the caster, it cannot be passed to another creature. Attempting to cast the spell on someone else's hammer or seeking to pass the hammer to another creature immediately negates the spell.\n\nShades of Rhondang ends if subjected to a successful dispel magic or similar effect, if the caster is slain, rendered unconscious, or releases his grip on the handle. Since the caster must retain a hold on the hammer to prevent the spell from ending, he or she cannot cast spells that require somatic components, nor perform any actions that require the use of both hands.\n\nThe material component is the caster's holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Granted by the gnome god Randal Steelskin."

The priest casting the spell can charm sharks whose total hit points are less than or equal to his or her own.

It inflicts no damage on the foe, but all of the foe's attacks are at a -3 penalty to attack rolls and a -1 penalty to damage. In addition, the shield-easier has a +2 bonus to all saving throws vs. attacks, including spells (for spells that normally allow a saving throw).\n\nA shield of the god can be set in a doorway or passage to simply block opponents from getting to the caster, who can cast other spells of 4th level or less through it without affecting the shield.

The sound is illusory and is, therefore, impossible to find. The affected creature wanders aimlessly in the area of effect looking for the source of the music. The desire is so all consuming that the creature ignores food and treasure, though not obvious dangers. (The creature can be caught by hidden dangers, of course, and many who wade or swim out into the sea risk drowning or attack.) The creature fights all attempts at constraint by either friend or foe. In the first round of combat, the creature is surprised, strikes last in the round, and fights at -2 to attack and damage rolls; thereafter, it fights at -1 to attack and damage rolls but normally otherwise. Should the creature be injured in combat or forced out of the area of effect, the spell is negated and the creature returns to normal immediately.\n\nTo use this spell, a spellcaster need not be underwater, but must be within 60 feet of the sea or the spell fails to work. Also, the creature affected by the spell must be in the area of effect when the spell is cast; this area encompasses a globe with a radius of 60 feet plus 30 feet per level. Those who wander into the area of effect after the casting are unaffected. The creature is allowed a saving throw vs. spell is modified by the Intelligence of the creature. The more intelligent the creature, the more beautiful the music seems. Creatures of Intelligence 4 or less (semi-intelligent) roll with a +2 bonus on their saving throw. Those of Intelligence 5-7 (low) roll with a +1 bonus. Those of Intelligence 8-12 (average to very) roll normally. Creatures of Intelligence 13-14 (high) save with a -1 penalty. Those of Intelligence 15 or greater receive a -2 penalty. The caster can affect one creature for every three levels attained (e.g., one at 3rd level, two at 6th level, three at 9th level, and so on\n\nThe material component is any large, empty sea shell."

The caster must be able to see the sky to cast this spell, and must be in an area covered with sand or loose stone. Calling up a sirocco is dangerous, because the priest cannot control it once it is summoned.\n\nAt the end of the round in which the spell is cast, a blast of scorching wind emanates from the caster and sweeps along the ground before him, whipping up small objects and particulate matter, and carrying them along at tremendous speed. Creatures of size L and smaller must make a saving throw vs. petrification at -4 or be bowled over by the force of the wind, and spends both the current round and the next one in the sirocco attempting to stand. All items caught in the storm (including metal) are abraded by flying grit and must save vs. acid or be destroyed. Magical items save with their bonuses added to the basic roll. Living creatures suffer 2d10 points of damage per round of exposure.\n\nThe only way to escape a sirocco is to move outside its area of effect. Ground movement rates for all creatures inside are reduced to 10% of normal; all other movement (except innate teleportation or planar travel) is impossible. Killing the caster or rendering him unconscious will not end the spell, and he cannot end it prematurely even if he wishes. The caster is not bound to remain in place after the spell has been cast, but he cannot cast other spells until the sirocco has run its course or been dispelled.\n\nOnce the sirocco has started, it drifts in a random direction. Each round, select a direction to be 12 o'clock, and roll a d12. The number indicates the direction the sirocco moves for 2d10 yards.\n\nThe range of the spell depends upon the caster's level. The storm's center can be created at any point up to the limit of the range. The caster is not immune to the effects of the storm.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for Elemental priests of Air or Earth from the Dark Sun setting; otherwise, very rare."

While so protected, the priest receives a +3 bonus to all surprise checks, and any ability check made to determine the success of an immediate reaction to a dangerous situation is made with a +3 bonus. For example, if the priest is working his way along a high mountain ledge, the magic of this spell might warn of a powerful gust of wind in time to grab onto an outcropping of rock, and the priest would receive a +3 bonus to her Strength check to hold on to the rock spur. Likewise, if an ally would step onto a hidden pit trap, the priest realizes his friend's danger in time to make a desperate grab for his arm and receive a +3 bonus to his Strength check to hold on. In addition, sixth sense provides a +3 bonus to saving throws made to avoid natural hazards such as rockfalls, avalanches, and so on.\n\nThe material components are the priest's holy symbol and a drop of sweat.\n\nNotes: Granted by the elven god Corellon Larethian."

The fields do not hamper movement overmuch (no Dexterity penalties), but their density does slow movement rates by 1 point.\n\nThe magic allows creatures who would normally break through a crust of snow or ice to glide atop it by spreading out their weight. It also absolutely prevents their falling over due to an external thrusting force or attack, though they can deliberately launch themselves into a dive or fall. The prohibition on falling works only on upright bipeds of 9 feet or less in height and who have at least two walking limbs (legs). The magic does not permit water walking on open water, but does slow sinking in water from a plunge into a round long settling (allowing an alert victim to hurl at least one item from his person, or to make one grab at any nearby anchor point).\n\nWhile the snow boots spell last normally lasts for one round per caster level, a caster using the spell personally can dismiss it earlier if desired. Once brought into being, the snow boots effect cannot be transferred from one being to another.\n\nNotes: Granted by Auril, called Frostmaiden, of the Forgotten Realms setting.

        "Introduction": "This spell can only be cast to affect an area where there is an amount of snow of at least twice the caster's body volume. It causes the snow to rise up in a serpentine mass and strike at targets in an area of the caster's choosing. As the magic affects only snow, it can also be used to uncover buried items lost in the snow (which will be left behind by the moving snow) or lying on the ground beneath. A snow snake can also be ridden by its caster in a “wave” movement that carries the priest (only) a maximum of 20 feet upward and 50 feet horizontally.\n\nIts most popular use, however, is as an attack spell. It smashes down in a dome-shaped area 20 feet in diameter, extinguishing any fires present in that zone and crushing for 6d4 points of damage. If a snow snake extinguishes any fires when striking, all creatures in the hemisphere suffer an additional 1d4 points of harm from a flurry of scalding steam. Creatures in the hemisphere of effect are encumbered by deep snow and are slowed to half movement rate for as long as they remain in the affected area. (If they choose to leave the hemisphere directly, their movement is slowed only for the round after the strike of the snow snake.)\n\nAll creatures in the area of a snow snake strike are allowed a saving throw vs. spell. Those who succeed take only half damage and are considered unencumbered (but any steam damage takes its normal effect).\n\nAll items within the area of effect (except those worn or carried by a creature that successfully saves vs. the spell) must make item saving throws vs. crushing blow.\n\nIf snow snake spell is cast into an area that has been affected by an ice storm or cone of cold spell within the previous 4 rounds, its base damage becomes 6d6 points (steam damage is unaltered).\n\nThe material components are snow and a single tear, drop of spittle, or drop of water in the caster's palm (the last can, of course, be melted snow).\n\nNotes: Granted by Auril, called Frostmaiden, of the Forgotten Realms setting.

The created softwood is a living entity that inhabits the air envelope of the individual, sustaining his or her life at a lower level than normal. The individual is placed in suspended animation.\n\nThe softwood cocoon is extremely resistant to heat and cold. While the form within is unconscious, it cannot be harmed. A creature in a softwood cocoon could fall to earth and the heat and impact of the fall would be absorbed by the spell.\n\nThe softwood cocoon dissolves in open air. If it enters and stays in a new envelope of fresh air for longer than three turns, the softwood dissolves, letting the individual loose. A softwood spell cast in the open air will be effective for three turns, cocooning the target for 30 minutes, then dissipating in a single round.\n\nThe softwood spell was created as a defensive measure, to preserve those cast adrift in space. For each three levels of experience, a priest can affect an additional individual. An enterprising priest might use the spell as a handy method to contain enemies, and as a way to send both foes and mutinous friends into wildspace (and off their ships) without having to slay them.\n\nThe material component is any bit of bark. The softwood spell creates the same type of bark covering the body. (If maple is used, then the covering will appear as maple, if pine, it will appear as pine.) If the bark of a sentient or monster-type plant is used, the softwood has similar physical features, but lacks any special abilities of the original.\n\nNotes: Rare spell for priests from a spelljamming culture; otherwise, virtually unknown."

As long as the priest remains within a fixed radius of the point where the spell is cast, there is a reduced chance that any will intrude purely by happenstance. Should a chance encounter occur, the caster receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid it.\n\nThe radius of solitude, beyond which the priest cannot pass without ending the spell, is 10 feet per level of the caster. If the priest moves beyond the perimeter set when the spell is cast, the spell effect ends immediately and the normal probability of random encounters resumes (although there is no implication that an encounter will necessarily happen immediately thereafter). This spell also ends whenever the priest's presence is discovered by a sentient being or when another sentient being enters the radius of the spell effect, whether they are aware of the presence of the caster or not. Obviously, this spell has no effect if cast in the presence of other sentient beings.\n\nFor example, if the priest casts this spell in the middle of a forest, far away from any settlement or road, there is no chance of a random encounter disturbing his or her solitude. Still, someone specifically following clues to the priest's location (whether or not the tracker is aware of exactly whom he or she is seeking) would be totally unaffected by this spell's enchantment. If, however, the priest cast this spell within visual range of a road or other location with regular traffic, while the spell would ensure that no one would simply stumble across the caster as they traveled through the woods, it would provide no isolation from discovery by those who use the thoroughfare as a matter of course.\n\nThe material component is a handful of earth sprinkled along the perimeter of the region of enforced solitude.\n\nNotes: Granted by the elven god Fenmarel Mestarine."

The caster's holy symbol must be touched to the corpse within 1 turn per caster level of its death. If target creature makes a successful saving throw vs. death magic, the spell fails. Otherwise, the spell calls the life force of the dead being into the holy symbol. It will escape again, by itself, if the holy symbol is not touched to another object within 4 turns. (The corpse itself is not harmed by the soultheft.)\n\nThe object to receive the life force is first touched by the holy symbol as a secret word is spoken. The transfer takes 6 rounds to complete. If the transfer is interrupted, the life force snaps back into the holy symbol, but the transfer can be attempted again.\n\nOnce transferred, the life force empowers an item to function magically for 1 month or with 10 charges per level or Hit Dice (in life) of the dead being. This spell uses a trapped soul for an engine to power a previously-enchanted magical item. It cannot be used to turn a plain item into a magical one; in other words, one cannot use soultheft to turn a sword into a holy avenger +5. The magical item must either be specially crafted to harness a stolen life force (in which case the time duration is used) or must be a charged item that is already enchanted (in which case the recharging function applies). Once the duration is at an end, or the charges are used (such charges are used first), the spirit is released unless the spell is renewed.\n\nRenewing soultheft requires only the enchanted item; the original corpse is not needed. When the spell is renewed the life force must make a successful system shock check (based on Intelligence rather than Constitution) or be annihilated.\n\nThe being whose life force has been stolen cannot be contacted, raised, wished back, or otherwise called back to living existence unless the object empowered by the stolen life force is identified, seized, and held by the being doing the raising. The enchanted object betrays the fact that it holds the essence of the particular being to any magical scrutiny – that is, a detect magic not only shows a magical aura, but reveals the ghostly image of the stolen soul trapped within the item.\n\nThe material component is the priest's holy symbol. A suitable enchanted item must also be prepared, but need not be present at the casting of the soultheft (but must be present at any renewal).\n\nNotes: Granted by the drow god Vhaeraun."

A dead creature of different alignment or of higher level or Hit Dice than the caster's level receives a saving throw vs. spell. A dead creature that successfully saves can refuse to answer questions, ending the spell. At the DM's option, the casting of this spell on a given creature might be restricted to once per week.\n\nNotes: Common for oriental priests; otherwise, very rare."

        "Introduction": "When this spell is cast, the shukenja projects a special aura that can be detected and read only by a dragon (or a dragon like creature such as a chimera, pseudo-dragon, firedrake, dragonne, and so on). The aura allows the dragon to determine that the caster is not hostile and is interested only in conversation. Any number of dragons may view the caster, and the chance that any sufficiently motivated dragon may feel an urge to attack the caster while the spell is in effect is only 2% per Hit Die of the dragon. Even if this check is successful, most dragons will have no wish to attack the spell-caster if no real reason for such an attack exists.\n\nThe dragon may decide to speak for one of two reasons. First, the dragon might genuinely desire conversation. Second, any dragon who slays a spellcaster while this spell is in effect becomes known to the deity of the priest; that deity will always make a point afterward of arranging for vengeance to be dispensed by various adventurers, though the success of these attempts must be played out or determined randomly by the DM.\n\nThe knowledge of this vengeance is made known to the dragon upon sighting the priest while this spell is in effect, and few dragons are willing to risk a god's displeasure. The worst that a dragon will do to the spellcaster in most cases is merely ignore him or make vaguely threatening gestures.\n\nThe shukenja, too, is bound by certain considerations. This spell fails if cast by a priest who secretly plans to harm the dragon. If the caster or an ally within the area of effect shows hostile intent toward a dragon, the spell ends immediately and the dragon to whom the priest is will, if it chooses to attack, gain a +2 bonus to all attack and damage rolls in combat with the offenders and those aiding them. The dragon gains initiative on its first attack even if the offenders make the first moves, as the spell invokes a curse that gives the dragon the upper hand for the first round of melee. The phrase “hostile intent” includes any action that would harm or immobilize the dragon, as well as any attempt to spy on the dragon's lair prior to an attack or theft. Wise spellcasters avoid entering a dragon's lair, as the temptation of seeing the dragon's treasure hoard might move the caster to contemplate a “hostile” action – and thus invite doom.\n\nSince this spell is actually cast upon the priest, the dragon receives no saving throw or magic resistance check. The dragon operates under its own free will and may decide to attack the caster once the spell's duration expires. The dragon is not obliged to be truthful or helpful, nor is it compelled to reveal its secrets. However, even evil dragons are more inclined to bend or shade the truth rather than to lie, as this may prove to be far more effective a tactic in certain situations (for example, if asked for information on a nearby ore tribe, a red dragon might disguise the fact that the ores give him treasure and sacrifices, and might offer misleading information as to its location and the composition of its forces). Divination spells can be used in conjunction with this spell to strengthen one's bargaining position.\n\nNotes: Rare for oriental priests; otherwise, very rare. (Updated from Dragon Magazine.)"

Priests of Eilistraee are trained to sing when in pain and may sing while dodging about in combat.

Failing anything else, a longsword driven point down into the\n\nground or a tripod of sticks surmounted by the caster's holy symbol can be used.\n\nThe spell can perform one of the following functions:\n\nSpellsong can cause an effect equivalent to almost any desired priest spell of 4th level or less. The spell has its normal effect, range, duration saving throws, and so on but without the usual gestures or (most often) material components.

Any other priests of Eilistraee present can join in this song without using a spell themselves, adding their knowledge to the casters. In this case, the immunity granted can be to any single spell that any member of the group has cast or experienced.\n\nA differently worded spellsong can heal 1d4+1 lost hit points to the caster or to any creature touched. Each additional singing priest who touches the injured creature while the spellsong continues heals 1d4 more points of damage.\n\nSeven or more priests of Eilistraee can work a cure blindness, slow poison, or cure disease instead of restoring hit points, if they will it so, and sing together.\n\nNine or more priests can work a dispel magic, remove curse, or neutralize poison spell. A dispel magic or remove curse spell functions at the level of the highest participating priest.\n\nTwelve or more priests can work a regenerate or restore an experience level lost within the last day.\n\nNotes: Granted by the drow goddess Eilistraee."

        "Introduction": "A spellweb is the drow priest equivalent of the 2nd level wizard spell web. The spell creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. The spellweb must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points (such as floor and ceiling or opposing walls), or the spellweb collapses on itself, and disappears.\n\nA spellweb glows with an eerie green luminescence when forming; it fades to white as it dwindles in intensity. At the caster's option, the completed spellweb can be lightless, or can glow with a very faint pearly radiance, aiding creatures in locating it. Once this decision is made, it cannot be changed.\n\nPriests of all levels can feel when any spellweb they have cast is disturbed, damaged, or expires. This tenuous linkage does not cause the priest any pain, nor can it be used by any known creature as a way of contacting or otherwise harming the caster. The caster cannot cause the spellweb to melt away before its duration expires until 9th level, whereupon the caster gains the ability to cause his spellweb to dissipate in 1 round, by utterance of a particular command word.\n\nA spellweb covers a maximum area of 7,000 cubic feet (for example seven 10 x 10-foot cubes). Creatures caught within the area of a spellweb, or who subsequently touch its gluey fibers, become stuck fast. Anyone in the area of effect of a spellweb as it forms is allowed a saving throw vs. spell at a -2 penalty. If the saving throw succeeds, they have managed to jump free of the forming spellweb (if unable to do so, the web in their area is at half strength).\n\nEngulfed creatures of less than 13 Strength are trapped until the spell wears off or they are freed by another creature. Creatures of 13 to 17 Strength can break through one foot of spellweb strands per round. Creatures of 18 or greater Strength can break through two feet of webs in a round. Creatures of Huge or larger size, and possessing strength and bulk normal for their size (for example, a giant slug), can brush through 10 feet of webs per round.\n\nMissile fire is generally ineffective against creatures trapped in webs. Creatures stuck on the outside of a web are reduced to AC 10 (9 if they currently possess either Strength or Dexterity scores of over 15; 8 if both ability scores exceed 15).\n\nSpellweb strands are readily flammable. A magical flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire – such as a torch, flaming oil, or candle – sets a spellweb alight. It burns away in a single round, freeing trapped creatures amid much choking smoke (visibility is reduced enough to cause a – 2\n\npenalty to all attack rolls the round following the spellweb's ignition). All creatures within or stuck to a flaming spellweb take 2d4 points of damage from the flames, before they are freed.\n\nThe material components are the priest's holy symbol, a crystal of any size and type (e.g. a globe around creature diamond or a tiny grain of sugar or salt will serve equally well), and a piece of spider web.\n\nNotes: Rare spell granted by the gods of the drow."

Movement is silent, unless loose rock, and so on is dislodged. Objects that weigh less than 1 pound will stick to the affected being's hands and feet for the spell duration, making certain types of spellcasting virtually impossible. The effect can be prematurely ended by the caster, by pronunciation of a word (if the affected being is not the caster. the caster must be within a range of 10 yards per level for the word to have any effect).\n\nSufficient force will tear a spider climbing being away from the surface clung to; the DM determines what occurs according to the situation.\n\nNo material component is required. If the caster is also the recipient of the spell, its duration can be (by silent will) stopped and started; that is, a climber who reaches a ledge can suppress the effect and sleep, cast other spells, and engage in other activities, activating the spider climb later in order to climb down.\n\nThis option is not available to creatures other than the caster. Such beings must be touched for the caster to transfer the magic to them. This can be done at any time during the life of the spell – that is the priest can spider climb for a time, touch another being and, by will, transfer the ability to that other being for the remaining time. A being unwilling to be affected is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to negate the effect (this ends the spell immediately).\n\nNotes: Granted by the drow goddess Lolth."

This spell does not give the caster any direct mental contact with the spider, and does not confer any sort of control over the arachnid, or ability to learn its thoughts or emotions.\n\nMost spiders have eight eyes (two compound, six simple) whose vision is not readily understandable to most intelligent races. The spell allows the caster to comprehend what the spider sees (with range, focal viewpoint, and usually infravision) as readily as the spider does. The range between spider and caster is limited only by the spell duration and the spider's travels, but the spell is broken if either spider or caster move to another plane of existence. The interposition of certain magical barriers, such as the border of a minor globe of invulnerability or any more powerful spell, between arachnid and caster will also end the spell.\n\nUsually small, harmless spiders are employed by casters of this spell, to serve as spies where the caster dare not go – but often, frustratingly, a spider will not go or look where the caster wants it to, unless controlled or influenced by additional spells.\n\nSometimes, this spell is cast on a giant spider (the caster requires a successful attack roll if the spider is hostile and not surprised) to see through its eyes while battling it, so that the caster and companions can strike from areas that the arachnid cannot see.\n\nNotes: Granted by the drow goddess Lolth."

        "Introduction": "The alter climate spell allows a to priest subtly affect the pattern of weather over a large area for a long period of time. During the preparation time, the priest must travel in the 40 square miles to be affected, spending at least four hours each day for a minimum of 30 days studying the local weather and experiencing the land's bounty and hardships. Once cast, the spell's duration is equal to five times the number of days the priest spent studying the area.\n\nIf the spell is cast to improve the weather, normally scant rainfall is supplemented mildly, and the severity of winds and storms are reduced for the duration of the spell. Existing croplands in the area of effect provide an abundant harvest, and most likely a surplus the locals can sell. Other existing plants are also fruitful, but alter climate does not by itself create new plant life. If cast in conjunction with a prolific vegetation spell, any barren land (stony barrens, sandy wastes, and so on) grows grass and scrubs (much like scrub plain terrain) after 10 days and for the duration of the spell. The accelerated rainfall levels are very gradual and are spread over the duration of the spell – there is no flash flooding or excessive erosion.\n\nIf the caster worsens the weather, rainfall is cut to drought levels and the severity of sand and wind storms increases. Crops in the affected area fail, leaving the fields dried and nearly ruined. Other vegetation may also be destroyed, depending on the terrain. Areas of scrub plain become sandy wastes after 30 days, and the land does not naturally recover its scrub covering if the spell lasts more than 300 days. Areas of forest become sandy wastes after 600 days, and the land does not naturally recover its trees or other plant life if the spell lasts more than 1,500 days. Magical vegetation is unaffected.\n\nIn either case, the spell's effect on the weather is not immediately apparent. A casual observer may never realize what is happening until half a year or more has passed.\n\nThe material components area specimens of every type of weather common to the area – a cup of rainwater, a handful of windblown sand, and a piece of tree or rock split by lightning. The priest must collect these during the time of preparatory study.\n\nNotes: Granted to air and water elementals, common."

        "Introduction": "This spell lets the priest “reset” another individual's alignment after it has somehow changed. The priest invokes the favor of powerful beings within the desired alignment to accept a being that has strayed back into the ranks of the faithful. Usually, a priest is sought out by an individual (or the individual's friends) whose alignment has somehow changed. The priest must be of the individual's original alignment.\n\nDuring the preparation time, the repentant individual must try to avoid his or her current alignment and aspire to the original alignment – most often through inaction, but good role-playing should be a bonus for a player character. Meanwhile, the priest contacts a powerful being of the appropriate alignment. Powerful beings aligned to good/evil or law/chaos exist in the outer planes. Powerful beings of a neutral alignment reside mainly in the inner, elemental planes. Particularly powerful creatures, such as advanced beings, spirits of the land, or other Athasian beings may also be suitable at the DM's discretion.\n\nThe priest contacts the being either magically, psionically, or physically three times during the preparation period, once every 1S days after the preparation has begun. The contact is brief but probing – the priest must plead the case with the powerful being. Since priest and being are of the same alignment, the contact is never hostile, though it may not be successful. Based on the sincerity of the individual desiring the change, the priest's belief in the individual, and the player's role-playing, the DM decides if the meeting is successful. If not, the priest must make contact again after 1S days. After three successful meetings, the spell can be cast.\n\nThe casting places both the individual and the priest great risk. If the priest has acted in any way contrary to his or her alignment, or if the repentant individual has not done all he or she can do to change his or her ways during the preparation time, the spell goes drastically wrong. The priest immediately changes alignment to match that of the repentant individual, and the individual loses half of accumulated experience to date. Once this has occurred, both are barred from using the cleanse spell in the future. If the DM is convinced that both priest and repentant character have acted properly, the spell works and the character regains his or her original alignment.\n\nThis spell relies on the role-playing of the character and the DM's interpretation of events and motivations. The DM plays the part of the powerful being, watching out for the best interest of its alignment. Flagrant disregard for alignment while under this intense scrutiny should cause the spell to fail. Use the three meetings of the preparation period to update the characters on their progress – a series of failed meeting should dissuade them.\n\nThe material component is a magical item usable only by one of the priest's alignment. It is destroyed when the spell is cast.\n\nNotes: Granted to all elementals, common."

The maximum radius of the oasis is 30 yards per caster level beyond 20th; the priest can create a smaller oasis if desired.\n\nThe preparation time is the time required to erect the circle of stones. Each stone must be at least 12 feet tall and no more than 4 feet wide or thick; rough-hewn and oblong; and set into the ground to stand on end. One stone must be placed every 10 yards around the circumference of the proposed oasis (the table shows how many stones must be erected for oases of various sizes.)\n\nCutting and placing a single stone requires 49 worker-hours, provided stones are readily available in the area and the workers have appropriate tools (chisels, spikes, hammers, rollers). If tools or ready stones aren't available, this time may increase or, at the DM's discretion, the preparation may be impossible. Also, particularly skilled or capable workers (such as dwarves, half-giants, or slaves trained in quarries) may cut the time by as much as half. The priest can erect the stones personally by physical or magical labor, or enlist the help of other creatures that share his or her alignment (if any laborers are not of the priest's alignment, the spell will fail when cast). After the last stone is place, the priest casts create oasis from the exact center of the ring. Provided all the stones are in place at the time of casting, interruptions that may have occurred during their placement won't negate the spell.\n\nWhen the spell is completed, the circle inside the stones is instantly transformed into a plat-filled, water-rich oasis. The trees and bushes are laden with nourishing, delicious fruits, and small game birds and animals appear, supported by springs and pools of fresh, cool water. The oasis can also sustain one human-sized creature for every 36 square yards, as shown on the table. Each night, game creatures, fruits, and water are replenished. Defiling magic still causes permanent damage – subtract the damaged area when considering the oasis's ability to support living creatures.\n\nThe oasis remains intact until the priest either voluntarily ends the spell or physically moves beyond the ring of standing stones. Once the spell ends, the oasis and the standing stones vanish, leaving the exact terrain that existed before. The spell also ends if the priest is slain.\n\nThe material components are the standing stones themselves, which vanish when the spell is broken.\n\nNotes: Granted to air, earth, and water elemental, common."

        "Introduction": "This spell lets the priest disrupt the magical link between templars and their sorcerer-kings, cutting off their source of spells. That link is a complicated affair, based on magic, psionics, and physical law; it is possible to block it by setting up interference or “static,” effectively creating an umbrella under which the link cannot exist.\n\nThe priest must choose one sorcerer-king and study his activities during the preparation time – only templars who worship that sorcerer-king are affected. The priest must learn of the sorcerer king's activities, his organization of templars, and something about his long-term goals. Therefore, the priest must spend the preparation time near the sorcerer-king, either in his city-state or in nearby fields.\n\nThe spell creates a series of connected circles, each 5 miles in diameter, one per level of the caster above 20th (each corresponds roughly to a single hex on the Tyr region map in the Dark Sun boxed set). The arrangement of the circles is completely up to the caster, but the first must be centered over his or her location at the time of casting. For example, with the first centered over the caster, the rest could stretch in a straight line in any direction or be clustered to blanket an area.\n\nAny templar under a circle cannot receive additional spells. Those currently memorized can be cast normally. Since the disruption spell has no other tangible effect, an affected templar may not be aware of it until he receives no spells, and even then, may not know why that is. The spell blocks the ability to receive spells, but doesn't block a sorcerer-king from sending: if a sorcerer-king is in the area of effect, his templars outside the area still receive their spells.\n\nInterference with a sorcerer-king and his templars certainly draws their wrath. If the spell is cast within a city, chaos reigns for the duration of the spell as many vital services grind to a halt.\n\nSuch powerful magic can be traced (psionically and magically), so the caster should have an escape plan).\n\nThe material component is one of the sorcerer-king's obsidian balls. The priest can obtain it personally or hire others to get it.\n\nNotes: Granted to air elementals, common."

The area of effect is one square mile per caster level beyond 21st, but the spell affects only one grain crop planted in that area; the type of grain must be specified before the spell is cast.\n\nDuring the preparation time, the priest must spend 3 hours per day praying over the seeds to be used for the crop and at least 3 hours per day traveling and blessing the fields to be planted. This process must continue for at least 15 days. The local farmers must still plant the seeds before the spell can be cast.\n\nOn Athas, typical grain crops require a full 120 days to reach harvest, though some crops may take as few as 90 or as many as 150 days. The hasten crops spell reduces the normal time it takes to grow the grain crop from seed to harvest by the days spent in preparation. Minimum growing time is seven days. The spell grants no magical properties or protections to the crop as it is growing – natural or manmade disasters can still wipe it out.\n\nAthas has no major changes in seasonal temperature and rainfall that govern growing seasons. However, when a particular crop must be grown at a specific time of the year, this spell must be cast toward the beginning of that time. During the 6-hour casting time, the priest must have the cooperation of at least 100 local farmers and other folk to engage in a planting festival. Portions of the seed crop are burned, a bountiful feast is prepared and eaten, and the locals dance in honor of all the elemental planes that make their agriculture possible.\n\nThe material components are grain seeds taken from some other bumper crop carried in baskets made by the local children. The baskets and grain are burnt in the festival's central bonfire.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, blight, causes existing grain crops to wither and die. The area of effect is the same, and the priest must still indicate which particular grain crop is to be affected. Other crops and plants are unaffected. Blight and hasten crops cancel each other in the same area of effect.\n\nThe material components for the reverse are a pinch of salt and a bit of moldy bread.\n\nNotes: Granted to elementals, common."

Unlike the insect plague spell, these insects are magically created; the spell can be cast where no natural insects exist. Each insect is small, barely the size of a pea, but by the thousands or even millions they cause horrendous destruction.\n\nDuring preparation, the priest clearly pictures the insects to be conjured and the type of destruction they will inflict. This requires secluded concentration for the entire period.\n\nWhen cast, the spell calls one cloud of insects per caster level above 15th. Each cloud is roughly a sphere of 1 S-foot radius that contains many thousands of individual insects. Each cloud has a movement rate of 24 and is completely under the priest's control. Each can perform a different task, provided it remains within range of the caster.\n\nCreatures caught in a cloud can see no more than 5 feet away. Spellcasting is impossible. Each creature suffers 5 points of damage each round in the cloud, regardless of Armor Class (invisibility is no protection). All creatures with 4 Hit Dice or less, flee and scatter, those with less than 8 Hit Dice must make a successful morale check or flee as well. The priest cannot choose to affect only selected individuals within a cloud.\n\nA cloud descending on crops devours its volume per turn, wiping out whole fields in a few hours. In a city or village, the townspeople panic while the insects destroy all unprotected foodstuffs and all wooden and tarp construction. Several clouds can easily surround a group or block a road.\n\nThe insect host can be dissipated by a successful dispel magic. It can also be blown back by a powerful, magical wind, dispersed for a time by an air elemental, or temporarily held off with smoke, thought the last will only work for a few rounds. Area-effect magic such as fireball can destroy large numbers of the magical insects, but individual attacks have very little effect.\n\nThe material component is a blown glass model of a locust or some other insect, filled with gem dust (100 gp minimum).\n\nNotes: Granted to air elementals, common."

For example, a lawful good priest must select a chaotic evil creature. True neutral priests cannot cast this spell.\n\nDuring preparation, the priest must cast a gate spell to call the creature to the Prime Material Plane. Because the creature called for may or may not step through the gale – and even if it does, it may immediately attack the priest – the preparation is hazardous. When the creature of opposite alignment arrives, the priest must personally subdue it, without help from others. Once the priest inflicts damage equal to half the creature's hit point total by any means, the planar vassal spell can be cast.\n\nUpon completion of the casting, the planar creature immediately becomes a discontented vassal of the priest. It grumbles and complains about duties, but performs them, albeit slowly at times. The vassal obeys the letter of all commands, but tries to violate their spirit when feasible. The planar vassal has no obligation to protect the priest unless so ordered. Planar creatures with the power to call others of their kind can be ordered to do so, but those new creatures are in no way controlled by the priest. Once the seven days have passed, the planar creature most likely (75% chance) attacks the priest; otherwise, it simply returns to its home plane.\n\nOther planar creatures may notice their associate's absence and come to investigate. Also, once a creature is free, it may plot revenge – subtle priests often see to it that their planar vassals are slain carrying out their duties. Those surviving this treatment never forget an enemy.\n\nNotes: Granted to elementals, common."

Upon casting, a “portal” opens to the pocket dimension from the Prime Material Plane. The portal is an invisible square, 40 feet on a side, standing just at ground/level. Anything that passes through the square enters the pocket dimension – it cannot return until the portal is accessed (see below). Anything living can walk through the portal.

The spell has two forms – immediate and erratic. The caster chooses which occurs at the instant of casting.\n\nImmediate: The priest simply chooses the new direction the wind should take. Once cast, the wind ceases completely for one round, then resumes with equal force in the new direction. This can move smoke, clouds, fog, and spells with similar effects. (For wind effects, see the DMG. page 127.)\n\nErratic: The wind's direction varies wildly, changing drastically several times per round for the duration of the spell. All nonmagical missile fire in the area of effect suffers a -5 attack penalty (for Battlesystem games, this is a -2 penalty to every missile AD rolled). Flying creature maneuverability ratings are reduced three grades (A becomes D, B becomes E). Flying creatures reduced below E crash, suffering falling damage (1d6 per 10 feet fallen, maximum 20d6). The erratic changes can disperse smoke, clouds, fog, and spells with these effects.\n\nIn either case, the spell's area of effect is a hemisphere centered on a point selected by the caster, extending 600 yards in every direction along the ground and 600 yards above it.\n\nThe material component is the breath of a flying creature.\n\nNotes: Granted to elementals, common."

Bonus points are gained immediately upon entering the sphere, but only once per creature per casting. An undead creature leaving the area does not lose the bonus.

Unlike most psionic enchantments, interruptions during a day's activities can be tolerated, provided the priest does spend six hours during each day in preparation.\n\nOnce the spell is cast, the mixture of bone and silt hardens to form a solid surface. The area solidified is a rectangle 100 yards across, and its length is one mile per caster level above 20th. Multiple castings can create longer bridges.\n\nThe hardened area can support any amount of weight, since it is solid from the surface down to the bottom of the Sea of Silt. If it is gouged or attacked, it reacts exactly like bone. When the spell duration ends, the bone softens over a period of three rounds back into its original silt-those standing on it likely disappear beneath the surface.\n\nThe material component is a large amount of bone dust. The caster must assemble at least 50 pounds of bone dust per day of preparation, or 2,250 pounds altogether. Generally, a humanoid creature has 25 pounds of bones. Larger creatures have 25 pounds per Hit Die. The caster need not personally gather or grind these bones, nor does the preparation time include this.\n\nNotes: Granted to elementals, common."

The storm itself must be of natural, nonmagical origin – a sand-, wind-, or lightning storm.\n\nDuring the preparation time, the priest must carefully measure the winds and the storms of the region, spending at least four hours per day observing these conditions. The spell cannot be cast until a natural storm gathers over the army to be transported. The total number of Hit Dice of creatures the storm legion spell can affect is given on the table.\n\nAll creatures, living or undead, can be transported by this spell. They must gather around the priest when the spell is cast, in military formations.\n\nUpon casting, the storm's winds and blowing sands dissolve the soldiers in the area of effect. In a matter of a few rounds, their forms are completely gone, their essence removed to the clouds above. All material possessions, magical and otherwise, are dissolved with the soldiers.\n\nThe caster is similarly dissolved, but he or she alone retains consciousness. During the journey, the caster has control over the storm's direction. A storm can usually travel between 10 and 40 miles per hour. Once over the desired target, the spell ends and the caster and army literally rain out of the skies.\n\nDescending as drops of blood, bone, and tissue, the fragments reassemble themselves in 10 rounds into the individuals they once were. During this time, they are helpless and vulnerable to attack. Any physical attack made on the incomplete form of a soldier destroys it – it will never reform. The caster reassembles normally, and is just as vulnerable to attack. Once the 10 rounds pass, the subjects are in exactly the relative positions they had when taken up into the storm, with the same equipment as before.\n\nIf the spell is dispelled while the storm is still in motion, all those carried within are slain. Once cast, the storm cannot be affected by other weather-affecting magic.\n\nThe material component is the standard or insignia of an army that was defeated during a storm.\n\nNotes: Granted to elementals, common."

Terrible wind or lightning storms, torrential downpours, incredible heat or cold, hailstones, or even snowfalls are possible. The weather condition created slows and damages all creatures within the area of effect, including the caster. Creatures caught in wild weather move at one-third their normal movement rate. Creatures caught in the open take 1 point of damage per turn until they find cover – even going to ground and covering oneself is sufficient, but in that case, movement is halted.\n\nIf the weather created might be considered harmful to the land or its plants and animals, then a spirit of the land might intervene, at the DM's option. The spirit must believe that damage would be unnaturally severe (weather is, after all, a natural phenomenon); spells aimed against other trespassers on its lands rarely interest it. The spirit can make a special saving throw to negate the spell effects, saving on a 1 d20 roll of 5 or higher.\n\nThe material component is a large glass bottle with air collected at a location where the weather created is common. The priest must wander through the area to be affected for the entire preparation time for the spell, occasionally uncorking the bottle to release some of the air.\n\nNotes: Granted to elementals, common."

A subject who fails a saving throw vs. spell with a -4 penalty is enveloped in darkness and transformed into a silhouette. The silhouette then constricts and squeezes into a tiny, black, marble-size sphere that is pulled by the tendril into the Minion's hand. The darkness then dissipates, leaving a clear, crystal walnut in the Minion's hand surrounding the marble-size black sphere that is the imprisoned being. A being who makes a successful saving throw vs. spell is unaffected by the vine like tendril, and the spell dissipates immediately.\n\nThe clear spirit prison lasts for 1 day per level of the spellcaster.

Otherwise, the item is allowed an item saving throw vs. crushing blow with a -1 penalty for every four levels of the druid (magical items have bonuses as noted in the DMG).\n\nAny creature within a certain distance takes damage from the flying splinters. The affected area depends on the size of the splintered object: 2 feet, plus 1 additional foot per 20 pounds mass. The splinters cause damage equal to 1 hit point per 7 pounds of wood. Thus, a spear shaft inflicts 1 point of damage to any creature holding it or within 2 feet.\n\nDamage caused by the splinters is reduced by a value equal to the Armor Class of the creature subtracted from 10. Thus, a creature with AC -1 is protected from 11 points of damage.\n\nA creature's Dexterity is reduced by 1 point for every 5 points of damage inflicted by this spell until such time as all splinters are removed.

        "Introduction": "The stone curse spell allows the priest to weaken stonework progressively over time by changing it into a spongy, soft material. When the spell is cast, an initial volume of stone is rendered soft, spongy and porous, being altered to a substance so brittle that it can easily be broken off and crushed in the hand. This fact is not obvious in the appearance of the stone, however. Only a creature with some expert ability in evaluating stonework can detect a stone curse. For instance, a dwarf or an individual possessing the Stonemasonry non-weapon proficiency can recognize a stone curse on a d20 roll of 19+ upon casual inspection. A detect magic spell reveals Alteration magic at work in the area of effect, as does direct tactile exploration (simply touching the stone is not sufficient).\n\nThe danger of a stone curse is that it can spread undetected. Each day following its casting, a further adjacent volume of stone equal to the original volume is also transformed by the spell. Eventually, this may have some important structural effect, like the crumbling of a supporting wall or the collapse of a mineshaft or tunnel, as the DM deems fit. A stone curse can be negated by a remove curse, a successful dispel magic, or by a spell that changes the nature of the stone more dramatically, such as transmute rock to mud.\n\nA stone curse can inflict damage upon creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth, such as xorn, galeb duhr, and the like. The caster must make a successful attack roll. The spell otherwise inflicts 1d4 points per level of the caster. A successful saving throw indicates the damage is halved. Likewise, a wizard employing a statue spell or a priest employing a meld into stone spell suffers damage from a successful stone curse attack.\n\nThe material component is a small chunk of very soft sandstone\n\nNotes: Granted by Iuz the Evil of the Grey-hawk setting."

The second is a cloud whose dimensions do not exceed 120 feet (for example, the cloud might be 40 feet wide, 20 feet tall, and 60 feet long).\n\nThe reverse of this spell, stone quench, clears twice the area of effect of a stone storm of dust, dirt, and other particles suspended in the air. Thus, a dusty haze that obscures vision and impedes breathing (such as that generated in battle or by an avalanche) is cleared instantly. Magic of 6th level or less that creates such effects is instantly ended (dust devil, wall of sand, sandstorm, and so on).

This spell is often used to devise a trap, holding boulders as deadfalls above archways (including castle or delve entrances), vault doors, thrones, bathtubs, beds, or other strategic areas.\n\nRelease can be accomplished by the utterance of a word or phrase, (often a phrase spoken in the original spellcasting). The spell also might be keyed to specific conditions, like the 2nd level wizard spell magic mouth (in other words, “when the lock on the door is broken or picked” and so on).\n\nWhen the spell is triggered, the stone turns visible as it falls, inflicting 2d4 points of damage per level of the caster. Each creature in the area must make a saving throw vs. spell. Success allows a Dexterity check. A successful Dexterity check indicates the creature escapes damage completely, while a failed check means the creature takes half damage.\n\nSkilled dwarves often fashion false stone ceilings of smooth-finished stones and raise them overhead to serve as stone imps. A true seeing effect reveals the levitating stone clearly, but if the caster has prepared it with enough skill (using shaped stone blocks, or carved ornaments such as gargoyle-heads or vault arches), the viewer may not recognize the viewed stone as any sort of trap. The levitating stone does radiate magic, faintly – but then, many dwarven delves radiate magic from most of their stone surfaces, if spells have been used in their shaping or subsequent use. A suspicious thief can find the trap at half his or her normal Find Traps skill, and a successful Remove Traps check (also at half the usual chance) can bring down the stone without harm to the thief.\n\nThe material components are a speck of grit, a drop of water, an eyelash from any creature, and a pebble.\n\nNotes: Granted by the dwarven god Vergadain the Trickster."

        "Introduction": "This spell causes rocky materials present in an area to fall suddenly in one of four fashions. If this spell is cast within three rounds after a stonefire spell is cast by a priest of Moradin, the fiery damage of that spell is added to the striking damage of this one.\n\nIf cast underground, it causes stalactites to fall or starts a cave-in. A fall of stalactites forces the intended target creature to make 1d6 Dexterity checks (these represent the number of falling stalactites; if fewer stalactites are available, reduce the number of checks). Each failed check results in a hit for 2d6 points of damage. Exposed fragile items must make saving throws vs. crushing blow if in the affected area. This sort of attack is relatively unlikely (roll 1 on 1d6) to cause a more general cave-in. If it does, the next effect occurs as well.\n\nA deliberate cave-in causes 4d8 damage to all below it (save vs. petrification for half damage). If the situation makes it possible for a cave-in to miss intended target creatures, the priest must make a successful attack roll (at +5 bonus to the attack), as if attacking directly. A miss means the creature scrambled adroitly enough to avoid all damage.\n\nIf cast indoors, it causes a ceiling collapse. An indoor ceiling collapse causes only 3d8 points of damage (save vs. petrification for half), but damage to breakable items in room and the space above the ceiling must be considered. Beings that fall down with the ceiling suffer 3d6 points of damage (minimum; more falling damage might be taken at the rate of 1d6 per 10 feet fallen). A successful saving throw vs. spell lowers this damage by half.\n\nIf cast in open air, it causes one fist-sized stone to fall rapidly out of the sky and strike the intended creature, causing 3d4 points of damage (the creature is allowed a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the missile and all damage).\n\nThe material component is a handful (at least three) of finger joint-sized or larger stones or pebbles.\n\nNotes: Granted by the dwarven god Dumathoin."

The stone blackens, stretches to reveal holes, burns away from the edges of these holes in ever-widening cavities until large amounts of stone have actually been burnt away, and then smolders into quiescence again, creaking as it cools.\n\nThe stonefire gives off an acrid, billowing white smoke, an earthy, metallic stink, and flames that cause 2d6 points of fire and heat damage (per round) to creatures within 10 feet. Actual contact with stonefire causes 4d4 points of damage and forces a System Shock roll to avoid collapsing unconscious from the pain.\n\nCreatures especially susceptible to fire damage surfer double these effects. Creatures made of stone take 4d4 points of damage in the first round and a like amount each round until a successful saving throw vs. spell is made, checking each round. Creatures resistant to fire suffer 1d2 points of damage from contact with stonefire. (They suffer some damage due to the corrosive effects of the burning). Stone burned away by this spell is consumed, forever gone.\n\nIf key areas of stonework (such as pillars) or natural stone walls, ceilings, or supporting floors are burned away, collapses and cave-ins may occur. The effects of such cave-ins are detailed in the spell description for stone/all. Collapses entail the same damage, plus falling damage (and item saving throws) for beings and things that fall as a result of the spell. This spell cannot be precisely controlled, even with long practice; it is unsuitable for stone-carving or decorating uses. The caster can affect 1 cubic foot of stone per level; a man-sized statue is roughly 12 cubic feet.\n\nThe material components are a few grains of saltpeter and a piece of stone, which are rubbed together.\n\nNotes: Granted by the dwarven god Moradin."

This limit applies regardless of attack rolls and regardless of whether the attack was physical or magical. For example, a stoneskin spell cast by a 9th level caster would protect against from five to eight attacks. An attacking griffon would reduce the protection by three each round; four magic missiles would count as four attacks in addition to inflicting their normal damage.\n\nThe material components are granite and diamond dust sprinkled on the recipient's skin.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell granted by some dwarven deities, identical to the 4th level wizard spell of the same name.

The flight is at MV fly 18 (B), and responds perfectly to the will of the flyer, who can hover, stop, go backwards, and even hang in one place with enough stability to cast spells. Such spellcasting does not end the storm-rage, but does prevent the hurling of any lightning during the round or rounds in which it takes place.\n\nA stormrage spell enables its recipient to emit from his or her eyes two straight line lightning bolts per round, each of which do 6d6 points of damage. A successful attack roll, at the recipient's normal THAC0, is necessary to strike a desired target. Items are allowed saving throws vs. lightning if targeted and struck; if they fail, they are destroyed. Creatures receive a saving throw vs. rod, staff, or wand if struck; those that succeed take only half damage. Both bolts can be directed at the same target if desired (determine the results of each separately), but lightning bolts not hurled during a round cannot be used to augment the number or damage of bolts unleashed in later rounds.\n\nA stormrage ends when the caster wills it to, at the expiration of its normal duration, or when dispel magic is successfully cast on its recipient, whichever happens first. Until then, it drains 4 hit points from the recipient per round. (A recipient who discovers this effect and is no longer willing to be under the effects of this spell can end it after one round.)\n\nWhile under the effects of stormrage, the recipient is immune to all lightning and wind damage and can “stand fast” against natural and magical winds.\n\nThe material components are a feather from any sort of bird that can fly, a pinch of ash from any burnt organic material that was struck by lightning, and a piece of flint.\n\nNotes: Granted by Talos the Destroyer, of the Forgotten Realms setting.

When it is summoned, the priest must have cast a protection from evil spell, be within a protective circle, or have a special item used to control the spectral death. Otherwise, it attempts to slay its summoner and return from whence it came.\n\nThe spectral death returns to its own plane whenever the spell lapses, its mission is fulfilled, it is banished (by means of abjure, dispel evil, holy word, or some similar method), or the priest is slain. If the spectral death cannot complete its mission within 1 day per caster level, and none of the foregoing have occurred, it relentlessly tracks its summoner. If it confronts its summoner, it attacks in a rage, striking as a 20 Hit Die creature and inflicting 3d6 points of damage with each successful hit.\n\nWhen raging, the spectral death is 50% resistant to any attempt by the summoner to banish it back to its home plane (the quasielemental Plane of Vacuum). This is adjusted by 5% per level (or Hit Die) difference. The spectral death has 20 Hit Dice for this purpose, thus its resistance to a 15th level caster is 75%.\n\nNotes: Used almost exclusively by evil priests of the Mystara setting. (The details of the spectral death can be found in the Mystara Monstrous Compendium.)"

The casting time is 1 round per \"type level\" (a Type II varrangoin can be summoned in 2 rounds, a Type V takes 5 rounds, etc.). However, because of the chaotic nature of the Abyssal planes, there is always some chance that the summoning will bring forth a randomly selected varrangoin type. This chance is 50%, less 2% per level of experience of the priest. If a randomly selected type appears, use the table to determine the type appearing:\n\nLesser varrangoin summoned will do the priest's bidding to the best of their abilities, save that they will not behave in any obviously self-destructive manner. Greater varrangoin, however, have to be negotiated with and offered some reward or sacrifice for their services before they will serve the priest.\n\nThis specialized and limited form of gating draws forth an abyssal bat for a limited time only. At each dawn following its summons, the varrangoin is permitted a saving throw vs. spell and, if this is failed, it returns to its home plane. Saving throws must be made in the same manner each dawn following the summons in order for the var- rangoin to remain on the Prime Material. Varran- goin do not have true names or individual identities, so it is not necessary for the casting priest to be familiar with the details of the creature being summoned.\n\nThe material component is a small quartz prism crafted with asymmetric facets, contained within a brass sphere.

Those affected require twice their normal amounts of water if exposed to the sun for more than four hours, and may go into convulsions if not adequately hydrated.\n\nIf the saving throw is successful, the creature is affected as if by the 3rd level heat exhaustion spell. All attack rolls and saving throws are made at a -2 penalty until the effect is countered by cooling (a canteen of water poured on the head is sufficient), by magical healing (such as cure light wounds), or by a dispel magic spell.\n\nNotes: Common for priests of the spheres of Sun and Elemental Fire of the Dark Sun setting."

        "Introduction": "When this spell is cast, the priest is able to assume the form of any non-evil human form, sylvan creature, as adjudicated by the DM, from as small as a gorse (3 inches tall) to as large as a voadkyn (9 1/2 feet tall). Other commonly assumed forms include that of an atomic, brownie, dobie, dryad, grig, hamadryad, killmoulis, korred, leprechaun, nixie, nymph, pixie, satyr, sea sprite, seelie faerie, sprite, or sylph. It is not possible to assume nonhuman form guises, such as that of a centaur or unicorn, nor that of an evil sylvan creature, such as a bramble faerie or quickling. Furthermore, the priest gains the assumed form's physical mode of locomotion and breathing. No System Shock roll is required. The spell does not give the new form's other abilities (attack, magic, special movement, etc.), nor does it run the risk of the priest changing personality and mentality.\n\nWhen the new form is assumed, the caster's equipment, if any, melds into the new form (in particularly challenging campaigns, the DM may allow protective devices, such as a ring of protection, to continue operating effectively). The caster retains all mental abilities, including spell use, assuming the new form allows completion of the proper verbal and somatic components and the material components are available. A caster not used to a new form might be penalized at the DM's option (for example, a -2 penalty to attack rolls) until he or she practices sufficiently to master it.\n\nThus, a priest changed into a sylph could fly, but his magic resistance would be unaffected and he could not summon an air elemental or turn invisible at will; a change to a korred would provide an 18/76 Strength and the ability to hurl boulders but not the ability to laugh or to participate without risk in a korred dance.\n\nNaturally, the strength of the new form is sufficient to enable movement. The priest retains his or her own hit points, attack rolls, and saving throws. Only one form can be assumed by means of this spell, although the priest can revert to his or her normal form at any time, immediately ending the spell. A priest voluntarily returning to original form and ending the spell regains 1d12 hit points. The priest also returns to the original form when slain or when the effect is dispelled, but no hit points are restored in these cases.\n\nThe material component is the priest's holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Granted by the elven god Corel Ion Larethian."

        "Introduction": "This spell allows the caster to scribe any one of the potent runes described below. A symbol can be quickly scribed in the air or on some surface, or carefully inscribed on a surface.\n\nA quickly scribed symbol has a casting time of 3. The resulting rune becomes active immediately. It lasts one turn per caster level and glows faintly while it lasts. Symbols of fear, hopelessness, pain, or persuasion can be used in this manner. Symbols of death, discord, insanity, sleep, stunning, and spell loss cannot.\n\nThe only material components required are a small amount of mercury and phosphorus.\n\nA carefully inscribed symbol has a casting time of one turn. The symbol is inactive when finished and remains so indefinitely until triggered. Once triggered, it becomes active and glowing, usually lasting one turn per caster level. Some symbols can burn out more quickly. For example, a symbol of death ends when it has slain 80 hit points worth of creatures, or after one turn per level of the caster, whichever comes first.\n\nThe material components for a carefully engraved symbol are mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth at least 5,000 gp each.\n\nTo be effective, a symbol must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location; covering or hiding the rune renders the symbol ineffective. As a default, a symbol is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as selected by the spell caster: reads, touches, or passes over the rune; looks at the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. In this case, “reading” the rune means any attempt to study, identify, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a symbol to render it inoperative triggers it if it reacts to touch. To trigger a symbol, a creature must be within 60 feet of the rune.\n\nThe caster can set special triggering conditions of his own. These can be as simple or elaborate as the caster desires. Special conditions for triggering a symbol can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify. For example, a symbol can be set to activate when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches.\n\nA symbol's triggering conditions are defensive. A touch-triggered symbol remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a symbol cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe. Once cast, a symbol's triggering conditions cannot be changed.\n\nThe caster ignores the effects of his own symbols, and cannot inadvertently trigger them. When scribing a symbol quickly, the caster can instantly attune any number creatures to the symbol, rending them immune to its effects, provided the creatures are within 60 feet of the rune when it is created and that the caster is aware of their presence.\n\nWhen creating a carefully inscribed rune, the caster can specify a password of phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol. The caster also can attune any number or creatures to the symbol, but this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time; attuning small group (up to 10 creatures) takes an hour. Attuning an entire household (up to 25 creatures) takes a day. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer, as the DM sees fit.\n\nWhen triggered, a symbol affects all creatures within a 60-foot radius, except for the caster and any individuals attuned it. If a symbol has a pass-phrase, anyone using it remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the individual remains within 60 feet of the rune. An individual who leaves the radius and returns must use the pass phrase again.\n\nOnce triggered, a symbol remains active until its duration expires; creatures that subsequently meet an active symbol's triggering conditions suffer its effects. The symbols described below are the most commonly known.",
        "Lesser Symbols": "Fear: This symbol can be scribed quickly or carefully engraved on a surface. Creatures within the radius are afflicted by a powerful version of the 4th level wizard spell, fear. If scribed in the air, this symbol imposes a -4 penalty to saving throws against the fear effect. If the rune is carefully engraved on a surface, the saving throw penalty increases to -8.\n\nHopelessness: All creatures within the radius must attempt saving throws vs. spell, at a -4 penalty if the rune is carefully engraved on a surface. If the saving throw fails, the creature suffers from hopelessness for 3d4 turns. It submits to simple demands from foes, such as to surrender or get out; the effect is similar to the 3rd level wizard spell, suggestion. If no foes are present to make demands, there is a 25% chance that the creature takes no other action than to hold its ground. If the creature remains free to act there is a 25% chance it will retreat from the nine at its normal movement speed. In either case, the creature can defend normally if attacked.\n\nPain: Creatures within the radius suffer wracking pains that reduce Dexterity scores by two points and impose a -4 attack penalty. Both effects last 2d10 turns. This symbol can be scribed quickly or carefully engraved on a surface.\n\nPersuasion: This symbol can be quickly scribed or carefully engraved on a surface. Each creature within the radius must attempt a saving throw vs. spell, at a -4 penalty if the rune is carefully inscribed on a surface. If the saving throw fails, the creature becomes the same alignment as the caster for 1d20 turns. During this time, an affected creature becomes friendly to the caster as though subjected to the 1st level wizard spell, charm person.",

This symbol must be carefully engraved on a surface.\n\nDiscord: All creatures within 60 feet immediately fall into loud bickering and arguing. Meaningful communication is impossible. If the affected creatures have different alignments, they are 50% likely to attack each other. Bickering lasts 5d4 rounds, fighting lasts 2d4 rounds. This symbol must be carefully engraved on a surface.\n\nInsanity: One or more creatures within the radius, whose hit points do not exceed 120, become insane and act as though affected by the 4th level wizard spell, confusion. Insanity lasts until a heal, restoration, or wish spell is used to remove the affliction. This symbol must be carefully engraved on a surface.\n\nSleep: Creatures within the radius fall into a catatonic slumber if they have 8+1 Hit Dice or less (characters are affected if 8th level or less). Sleeping creatures cannot be awakened for 1 d 12+4 turns. This symbol must be carefully engraved on a surface.\n\nSpell Loss: Any creature within the radius immediately loses 1d4 spells from memory. The DM should determine which spells are lost randomly. Creatures with no memorized spells are unaffected. Creatures that have some memorized spells, but not enough to satisfy the loss, suffer no effect beyond the loss of all memorized spells. This symbol must be carefully inscribed.\n\nStunning: One or more creatures within the radius, whose total hit points do not exceed 160, are stunned for 3d4 rounds. Stunned creatures drop what they are holding and cannot take any meaningful actions. They cannot communicate, employ spells, use magical items, initiate psionic abilities, use spell-like powers, fight, or move freely, Movement is limited to one-third the creature's current movement rate, or a rate of 3, whichever is less. Attacks against stunned creatures gain a +4 bonus. This symbol must be carefully engraved on a surface.\n\nA successful dispel magic removes the effects of a symbol from a creature, unless the symbol's effect is instantaneous (death, spell loss) or the description specifies another remedy (insanity).",
        "Permanent Symbols": "A symbol can be rendered permanent with the 8th level wizard spell permanency, provided the rune is carefully engraved upon a permanent, non-portable surface such a wall or door.

The fable of Androcles pulling a thorn from the lion's paw provides a more poetic example of how to gain an animal's gratitude.\n\nThe uses of the tamed pet depend upon the intelligence of the animal. Relatively bright creatures might master half a dozen simple commands (coming when whistled for, running to fetch help on another command, attacking with its hooves, etc.), while notoriously stupid beasts – like sheep – can master only a single command.\n\nNotes: Restricted to shamans, uncommon."

        "Introduction": "By means of this spell, the priest can create a ripple in the time stream so that a physical effect occurs without the physical cause occurring. For example, the priest can cause a dart to appear in an opponent's neck without actually appearing to throw anything.\n\nDuring the casting of this spell, the priest enters an alternate time stream for up to one round per level of the caster. During that time interval, the priest can attempt to carry out any action normally open to him or her, and other creatures can react accordingly. When the casting is complete, the priest returns from the alternate time stream, although to observers it appears as if the priest spent only a single round casting a spell, and the effects of any action caused in the alternate time stream suddenly become apparent, without obvious cause or without any memory of such events by other participants. Any spells cast, charges employed, or other magical effects employed in the alternate reality are not used up when the priest returns to the original time stream.\n\nFor example, a 14th level priest casts temporal anomaly. For the next fourteen rounds, she interacts with the current situation normally. She could try to hit an opponent with a dart, but to do so would require a successful attack roll, and the opponent could react accordingly. She could also bind the wounds of an ally and cast cure light wounds upon him. When the priest returns to her normal time stream, observers will believe that the caster spent a single round casting a spell. Upon completion of the spell, however, the foe would suddenly sport a dart in the neck and the ally would suddenly be bandaged and cured.\n\nThe material components are the priest's holy symbol and a powdered ruby worth at least 1,000 gp.\n\nNotes: Granted by the elven deity Labelas Enoreth."

        "Introduction": "This spell makes up to 10 beings (the caster may be one of them) touched by the caster immune to the damage of all metal items. Metal blades and bars pass through protected beings as if their bodies did not exist. Willing creatures are automatically affected by a tenfold ironguard spell; hostile creatures are unaffected if they successfully save vs. spell (and the caster must typically make a successful attack roll to touch them, too). The strength of this magic is not altered by how many or few beings are protected by it.\n\nA being under the influence of a tenfold ironguard can pass through metal bars, gates, and the like as if a phantasm – but is brought up short by the presence of nonmetallic items (such as a wooden handle on a metal tool) or by enchanted metal. Heat, cold, and poisons still affect the guarded being, even if delivered by “harmless” metal weapons. Magical metal weapons deal damage equal to their bonuses, (those with no bonus inflict 1 point of damage per strike.) Spells whose effects involve metal (such as blade barrier) deal their normal effects to ironguarded beings. An ironguarded being pierced by or moving through metal when this spell expires is instantly slain.\n\nA tenfold ironguard has one important difference from the 5th level wizard ironguard spell: Each protected being can designate one metal item (one that they are holding and that the caster can touch during casting) to be unaffected by the spell. Thus, a protected being can retain a single weapon, tool, key, or other item. The item can contain other items (a metal chest full of coins, for instance) and still be considered “one item” (though if the coins spill, the guarded being will not be able to pick them up), but cannot extend its exemption from the spell to attached items. (For example, a breastplate made exempt would not extend its status to an adjacent gorget or any other part of the same suit of armor.) Metal pieces “fall through” the body of an individual, but leather straps typically work by hanging tightly from the body, and buckles still hold them together even though the metal in the buckles themselves can now pass through the wearer.\n\nThe caster cannot end the ironguard early by any known means – dispel magic and similar spells cannot remove its protection – but the death of the caster ends the magic instantly.\n\nThe material components are a handful of iron filings and a drop of aqua regia.\n\nNotes: Granted by Helm the Vigilant of the Forgotten Realms setting. This spell is found only in a few exceptionally rare tomes."

The onrush of sensory information allows the caster to know of all beings and objects in the area, including hidden and invisible creatures, traps, and magic items. The caster does not sense thoughts or detect powers of creatures and objects contacted. Because the spell accesses thoughts, any being whose thoughts are masked cannot be spotted solely with this spell. While the spell is in effect, the caster can take no other action, including movement and speech.

One thorn appears each round, inflicting 1d3 points of damage, until all the thorns have appeared. When the number of thorns exceeds the subject's experience level or Hit Dice, a creature still conscious becomes immobilized by the pain, unable to take any action.\n\nOne round after the last thorn erupts from the subject's flesh, the first one disappears. The thorns continue receding at a rate of one per turn. Immobilized subjects can move again once the number of thorns falls below their Hit Dice or experience level. For instance, say the body of a 4th level wizard has seven thorns. After four turns had passed, only three thorns would remain, so the wizard would no longer be immobile.\n\nCure spells can restore hit points but do not eliminate the thorns. Dispel magic will end the spell but prevents existing thorns from receding. A heal spell cancels the thornwrack, eliminates all existing thorns, and cures all damage.

The caster must walk through all the passages and rooms of the tomb, marking the walls, floors, ceilings, and doors with signs of the curse. During this time, the priest also sets down the exact conditions that will trigger the curse. They can be as simple as “any creature entering this tomb” or as complicated as “any mortal disturbing the remains of the king, removing his burial treasure, breaking or destroying his possessions, or defacing the tomb.”\n\nThe DM determines the exact effects. In general, the wording of the curse should be interpreted literally, though vague or unclear passages should be given unfavorable interpretations.\n\nThe sized of the warded tomb is limited; it can comprise an area no larger than a cube 30 feet on a side. If other priests assist the caster, however, each additional priest adds 10 feet to each side of the cube. Therefore, seven priests (including the caster) can ward a cube-shaped area up to 90 feet on a side.\n\nThe material components are the holy symbols of each priest involved. The symbols must be left in the tomb, frequently buried in the walls or floor. Optionally, a creature of the same race as the priest can be entombed alive instead of the holy symbol. A combination of creatures and holy symbols is acceptable, so long as each priest leaves one component.

        "Introduction": "Like the 1st level wizard spell find familiar, this spell allows a priest to summon an animal that represents some aspect of his or her faith. If the spell succeeds, the animal appears 1d6 turns after the casting and remains with the priest one day for each level of the caster.\n\nThe totem beast does not add hit points to the caster, nor is it linked in such a way that the two cannot be separated. The animal summoned to the caster is exceptionally intelligent for its species and understands all verbal commands issued by the caster. No mental telepathy exists between the pair. The animal does not understand speech or commands issued by anyone other than the caster, even if they speak the same language as the priest.\n\nDifferent gods grant different totem beasts to their followers. The priest has no control over the type of animal gained. The following list provides examples of animals that may appear to priests of different deities.\n\nThis list is not exhaustive; a different type of animal may appear to a priest depending on the god's wishes and the priest's location. A priest of Belinik in Khinasi lands may summon a hyena, for example. Lower level priests tend to gain smaller creatures, while higher level priests are sometimes granted larger beasts.\n\nThe totem beast may have up to 1 Hit Die for every three levels of the caster, up to the maximum Hit Dice normal for such a creature. If a 5th level priest of Erik cast the spell and was visited by a black bear, the bear could have up to 2 Hit Dice. The DM can grant maximum Hit Dice or roil for the possible range (in this case, 1d2).\n\nNo priest can ever have more than one totem beast at one time. The animal always departs peacefully at the end of the spell (unless it was mistreated, in which case it might leave earlier or turn on its master). The priest is free to dismiss the animal sooner if desired. A priest can summon only one totem beast in a 30-day period.\n\nSuccess of subsequent castings depends on the priest's treatment of previous animals. If an animal were endangered or mistreated, further attempts may fail until an amount of time has passed or the priest atones for his actions in kind (such as caring for sick or injured animals).\n\nThe material components are 10 gp worth of high-quality food appropriate for local animals (both carnivores and herbivores) and a miniature leash made of fine gold wire.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for priests of Cerilia, the Birthright setting."

        "Introduction": "Totemic magic is invoked by the practitioner painting or inscribing an image that conveys magical powers upon anyone bearing that image. Most totemic images take several hours to properly create, making such magic impractical for the average adventuring spellcaster. On the other hand, totemic inscriptions are powerful and can be prepared in advance based upon anticipated situations. Totemic image bonuses of the same type are generally not cumulative, nor can the same totemic image usually be applied multiple times to increase the effect. At 1st level (or whenever the spell is learned), the shaman learns one image that corresponds to his or her personal totemic animal; one additional totemic image can be learned at each additional experience level. A shaman can learn the totem magic only of those creatures with which he or she is familiar.\n\nEach image must be inscribed or drawn upon an appropriate surface. This can be done with a knife, paint, or other pigments. Once the image has been inscribed, the object functions as described below. Some images have a time limit after which the image is still visible, but has lost all its power. Such images can be renewed, a process that does not actually involve redrawing the image, but requires the same amount of time, during which the shaman chants over the image.\n\nTotemic images can be inscribed into items that will function for other individuals, but these require that some token from the individual be worked into its creation – a few hairs, a drop of blood, some object the individual has personally gathered on a special quest.\n\nNotes: Restricted to shamans and savage clerics.",
        "Totemic Images": "The following list describes several different totemic images, their powers, casting times, and limitations. The format employed is as follows: Name (Duration/Casting Time): Effect\n * Bear/Elephant (1 day/1 hour): This image can be inscribed upon an amulet, pendant, weapon, clothing, armor, or virtually any object that can be kept on an individual's person. While wearing the object, the bearer receives a +1 bonus to his or her Constitution.\n * Boar/Warthog (1 day/1 hour): This image can be inscribed upon an amulet pendant, weapon, clothing, armor, or virtually any object that can be kept on an individual's person. While wearing the object, the bearer can remain active at -5 hit points or above.\n * Coyote/Jackal (1 day/2 hours): The image of the crafty Coyote, inscribed upon a weapon, amulet, or piece of clothing brings bad luck to enemies. At the wearer's option, one opponent per encounter may suffer -1 penalty to hit, +1 penalty to AC, or -1 penalty to all saving throws. The wearer must decide upon the effect for each opponent. The decision cannot be changed or revoked.\n * Dolphin (3 months/3 days): This image is often carved or painted along the gunwales of canoes and small boats. It provides a +15% bonus to all Seaworthiness checks. Many Dolphins may be inscribed, often in association with the Gull image, but multiple images do not increase the symbol's effectiveness.\n * Eagle (1 week/1 hour): The sign of the Eagle increases the accuracy of a missile weapon. When inscribed on an arrow, quarrel, sling stone, or spear, an Eagle symbol improves the missile's chances to hit (not damage) by +1. This symbol cam be inscribed only on a missile. More than one Eagle image can be inscribed upon a missile. Two images have no further effect, but three images increase the bonus to +2. This is the maximum number of images allowed The Eagle image can be used with the Shrike and Hawk images. Once the missile is used, the power of the image is expended.\n * Firefly/Scarab Beetle (1 day/1 hour): This image can be carved upon a staff, wand, or amulet It provides the equivalent of the 1st level priest spell light on command. The light can be extinguished and renewed as the bearer wills for the duration of images' power.\n * Fox/Monkey (1 day/1 hour): When inscribed upon an amulet, a cloak, or a pair of gloves, the Fox symbol adds +10% to all thief skill rolls for the image's duration.\n * Gull (3 months/3 days): The totemic image of a gull can be carved or painted on the mast or tiller of a ship. It adds 6 to the ship's movement rate. While numerous Gulls are often inscribed on a ship, sometimes intertwined with Dolphins and other sea images, multiple images do not increase the symbol's effectiveness.\n * Hawk (1 week/1 hour): When inscribed on an arrow, spear, or other missile weapon, this symbol increases short, medium, and long ranges by 20 yards (60 yards total). Thus, a short bowls range (50/100/150), becomes equal to a long bow's range (70/140/210). The Hawk image (as the Eagle) can be inscribed only on the missile itself. Only one Hawk image can be inscribed on a missile at any one time. This symbol can be used with Eagle and Shrike images, within the limitations listed under those symbols. Once the missile is used, the power of the image is expended.\n * Horse/Zebra (1 day/1 hour): This image can be inscribed upon a pair of shoes, boots, or sandals. While bearing the rune, the user has a basic movement rate of 18 if man-sized, 12 if small.\n * Mountain Lion/Tiger (1 day/1 hour): This image can be inscribed upon an amulet, pendant, or any piece of jewelry or adornment. While wearing the object, the bearer is surprised only on a roll of 1.\n * Otter/Crocodile (1 day/1 hour): The totemic image of an otter is often inscribed upon a small pendant or earring. It gives the bearer the ability to swim like an otter (swim 18) and remain submerged without the need to breath for as long as 5 minutes at a time.\n * Owl (1 day/1 hour): The bearer of this symbol, which can be inscribed upon a pendant, amulet, brooch, tore, or circlet, can see in total darkness without penalty for the above duration.\n * Raven/Ibis (1 day/1 hour): The bearer of this symbol, which can be inscribed upon a pendant, amulet, brooch, tore, or circlet, receives a +1 saving throw bonus against spells and mental attacks.\n * Salmon/Python (1 month/3 days): This symbol can be carved on the gunwales of a small boat. Like all boats, the vessel can then move down-stream freely, but it can also move upstream at half the rate of the current, without the occupants having to row or expend any similar effort.\n * Shrike (1 week/1 hour): A single Shrike symbol increases a missile's damage by +1. Like the Eagle and Hawk images, it can be inscribed only on a missile. Three Shrike symbols increase damage by +2, the maximum bonus. The Shrike image can be used with the Hawk and Eagle symbols. Once used, the power of the image is expended.\n * Snake (1 day/1 hour): The Snake symbol can be inscribed upon an amulet, pendant, clothing, armor, or virtually any object that can be kept on an individual's person. While wearing the object, the bearer reduces the saving throw of any creature the bearer casts a charm or hold spell on by 1.\n * Stag/Cheetah (1 day/1 hour): The Stag symbol can be inscribed upon an amulet, pendant, clothing, armor, or virtually any object that can be kept on an individual's person. While wearing the object, the bearer receives a +6 bonus to his or her movement rate, and the ability to make running leaps of 20 feet, usable in one encounter.\n * Thunderbird/Lion (1 day/1 hour): This image can be inscribed upon an amulet, pendant, clothing, armor, or virtually any object that can be kept on an individual's person. While wearing the object, the bearer receives a +1 bonus to attack rolls and +1 to any saving throw against fear.\n * Tortoise/Rhinoceros (1 week/1 day): The Tortoise symbol can be inscribed on a piece of armor, an amulet, or a pendant Once inscribed, the symbol improves the wear's Armor Class by 1. Only one such symbol can be worn by an individual at any time.\n * Whale (3 months/3 days): Ships with this image carved into the strakes, gunwales, or ram need not make a Seaworthiness check if they ram another vessel. If ramming a living creature, the vessel inflicts 2d6 points of damage per 20 cargo tons (to a maximum of 9d6) against living creatures.\n * Wolf/Hyena (1 day/1 hour): This image can be inscribed upon an amulet, pendant, clothing, armor, or virtually any object that can be kept on an individual's person. While wearing the object, the bearer receives a +1 bonus to any tracking roll."

As such, the trance allows the shukenja to discover whether any supernatural or magical effects are at work in the area. For each round the shukenja remains in the trance, he or she feels the presence of any one lesser spirit, greater spirit, curse, permanent magical effect, or haunting, provided this is in the area of effect. The shukenja is able to determine the general type of thing contacted (natural spirit, evil haunting, etc.), but cannot communicate with it in any way or gain any other information about it. For example, the party stops at a deserted temple for the night. The shukenja enters into a trance, hoping to learn if supernatural forces are at work here. From the trance she learns that an evil spirit is haunting the temple. So prepared, the party can ready appropriate defenses or leave.\n\nNotes: Common for oriental priests; otherwise, very rare."

A priest who wishes to simply drop the seed can do so; if the priest wishes to toss the seed to some specific location within 12 feet, a successful Dexterity check is required – failure means a missed, but by no more than 3 feet. During its rapid growth, the tree tries to attain its full size and height, smashing through barriers with a Strength score of 25. Wooden structures splinter, rock walls, ceilings, and foundations split and crumble; even metal barriers bend or split against the massive growth of the tree. Should a structure collapse because of the tree's growth, creatures may have to make a saving throw vs. spell or take damage, at the DM's option. Though rapid, the growth of the tree can easily be avoided by most characters and creatures.\n\nThe material component is the seed itself, which must be undamaged but need not be magically enchanted before this spell is cast.\n\nNotes: Common for priests of the Dark Sun setting."

This spell can be cast only when the caster has taken a position in contact with the chosen tree that can be maintained for an extended period.\n\nAs long as the caster does not move (aside from small shifts in position) or break contact with the tree, he or she is cloaked by a simple illusion, appearing as a natural part of the tree. For example, if the priest who sits on the ground and leans against the base of the tree might appear to be an above-ground root. A caster who stretches out horizontally along a tree limb might appear to be part of a thick branch. A priest who curls up in a ball and sits at the base of a branch where it joins the trunk might appear to be a large burl. However, any method that can discern illusions or reveal hidden creatures reveals the caster's position immediately, although that will not automatically end the spell effect.\n\nA caster who gets a full night's sleep (8 hours) while the spell is in effect can tap into the life force of the tree. A night's sleep under the effect of a tree nap is equal to complete bed-rest, and naturally heals 3 points of damage for the day. If the tree is an oak. the healing is doubled to 6 hit points. If the oak is the home of a dryad or hamadryad, the healing is doubled again, to 12 hit points for a single night's sleep.\n\nThe material components are the caster's holy symbol and a drop of tree sap.\n\nNotes: Granted by the forest gnome god, Baer-van Wildwanderer."

Moreover, the caster's spirit merges with the tree at the character's death. No form of reincarnation or resurrection (except a wish) on the character's body will work unless it lies within 10 feet of the tree.\n\nOne year after the caster dies, the druid's spirit animates the tree as a treant. (DMs should roll up treant statistics for the tree at the time the spell is cast, to determine the tree's Armor Class, Hit Dice, etc.) The chosen tree must be of treant height; the exact size determines the size of the new treant, which possesses the caster's memories and personality but has no granted powers or spellcasting ability. It must communicate as a treant.\n\nThe DM decides whether to consider this treant an NPC or allow the player to control it. (DMs should use the guidelines that apply to PCs who become lycanthropes or undead.)\n\nHowever, a druid who uses tree spirit to link with a tree suffers any physical damage inflicted on the tree. For instance, if someone hacks at the tree with an axe and causes 4 points of damage, the druid also loses 4 hit points; the druid knows the tree has been harmed, but does not know the nature of the injury.\n\nIf the tree dies but does not sustain enough damage to kill the caster, the druid is stunned for 1d6 rounds and must make a successful System Shock roll to avoid death. Spells that heal the druid do not affect the tree.\n\nDamage to the druid does not affect the tree, as the extra energy the tree expends on strength and health makes any damage the druid sustains negligible to the tree. However, it's usually in the druid's best interest to have an animal friend or two guard the tree.\n\nIn addition, the druid should choose the tree carefully. If the surrounding land is cleared for construction work or lumber before the druid's prolonged life span finally ends, the druid is in trouble.\n\nCasting tree spirit first requires a full month's preparation. The druid lives near the tree during this time of prayer and meditation. Then a private bonding ceremony is conducted at the height of a solstice. This spell often is cast by ancient druids, who wish to preserve their wisdom or make sure their groves remain defended even after their death.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for druids; otherwise virtually unknown."

It confers total immunity to turning attempts upon chosen undead creatures within the area of effect. Only undead creatures with Hit Dice equal to half the caster's level or less can be so protected. Such undead moving farther than 30 feet from the caster lose this protection; they can be turned normally if another attempt is made. Note that the turnbane does not negate a successful turning in the event that turned undead creatures move back to within 30 feet of the caster.\n\nThe longer duration version lasts 3 rounds per level and allows the caster to protect undead with Hit Dice equal to or less than the his or her experience level. An opposing priest, cleric or paladin attempting to turn such creatures must first roll a number on 1d20 less than the caster's basic, unadjusted saving throw vs. spell. Failure to do so means the undead cannot be turned while they remain within 30 feet of the caster. This failure does not prevent others from trying to rum the same undead creatures; each separate turning attempt by another different priest requires a separate 1d20 roll. A successful roll on the 1d20 means the turning attempt is resolved normally.\n\nA successful dispel magic will remove the effects of a turnbane, as will a dispel evil cast into the area of effect of the turnbane. A holy word dispels a turnbane also.\n\nNotes: Granted by Iuz the Evil of the Greyhawk. setting."

The distance between the priest and the undead being does not matter, but they must be on the same plane. Unless the caster has some way to see the undead or its surroundings, the spells cast through the creature are hurled from it blindly.\n\nSpells to be cast through the undead creature can be chosen by the priest as needed. Up to one spell per round can be cast through the undead creature, until it is destroyed or until a maximum of one spell per level of the priest has been channeled through the focus. The spell ends after a maximum of 10 turns per caster level, even if the focus has not been exhausted.\n\nWhile undead focus does not grant control of the undead creature by itself, other magics or powers that allow control or augmentation of the undead creature can be used without hampering this spell.

By means of the undead form spell, the caster can assume the form of any type of undead of 8 Hit Dice or less that the caster is familiar with, provided the priest could possibly turn that undead type if six levels below his or her current level. Hence a 7th level priest could assume the form of a skeleton, zombie, ghoul, shadow, or wight, and an 8th level priest could assume any of those forms as well as that of a ghast. The only difference in abilities between a priest using undead form and true undead creatures is that those slain by the caster in undead form do not arise as undead creatures. Hence if the priest assumes the form of a wight and then drains all of the life energy levels of a foe, the foe does not later arise as a half-strength wight under his or her control.\n\nWhile in undead form, the caster cannot use spells or employ any other granted powers, spell like abilities, or other special abilities. Hit points, Intelligence, and Wisdom are unchanged, but otherwise the priest acquires the strengths and weaknesses of the assumed form including immunities to certain spells, if any.

The caster of undeath to death cannot choose to focus the spell on one undead individual and avoid affecting others, but the effects of the magic are not altered by the presence of varying numbers of undead. All potential victims make saving throws separately.\n\nThe sphere of effect is immobile once its focus is chosen by the caster; however, the focal point must be known or visible to the caster during casting. The sphere becomes active the instant its casting is complete and remains so until the end of the following round. The spell affects all undead that come into contact with any part of the sphere during that time. Living and dead creatures in the area of effect are affected by this spell in only one way (no saving throw to avoid): If they later die and attempts are made within 48 hours after the sphere of effect expires (or they leave or are removed from it) to animate them into undeath, all such attempts will automatically fail.\n\nThe saving throw against an undeath to death spell is modified as follows: Skeletons, zombies, ghouls, and all other undead of 2 Hit Die or less save at a -4 penalty; shadows, wights, ghasts, and other undead of 3 through 5 Hit Die save at -2; wraiths and other 6 Hit Die undead save at par (unmodified); mummies and other 7 Hit Die undead save at +2; vampires and other 9 Hit Die undead save at +4; ghosts and other 10 Hit Die undead at +6; liches and other 11 Hit Die undead save at +8, and “special” undead automatically save against this spell.\n\nSurviving physical remnants of undead turned to dead by means of this spell can be later animated to undeath again by other magic or used in such Kelemvorite spells as dead march. Parasites such as rot grubs, diseases (including mummy rot), and other conditions carried by undead affected by this spell are forever eradicated – the remains do not carry and cannot pass on such harmful phenomena.\n\nThe material components are a bone or bone fragment once part of an undead creature, a pinch of ashes from a fire over which carrion has been burned, and a pinch of graveyard dust.\n\nIf the caster of an undeath to death spell sacrifices a consecrated holy symbol of his deity in the casting of the spell (it must be shattered), undead who successfully save against losing their undeath still take physical damage of 3d4 points.\n\nNotes: Granted by the god Kelemvor, Judge of the Damned, of the Forgotten Realms setting.

        "Introduction": "A caster can transform one or more living creatures within a 30-foot radius into unwilling wood, causing them to sprout roots, branches, and leaves. The creatures become trees of a type native to the region and of the characters' age before the transformation. The spell works only if cast on beings occupying ground that could support a tree; recipients flying or suspended in water at the time of casting remain unaffected.\n\nThis spell can mutate a number of creatures equal in total Hit Dice (or levels) to the caster's level. If the area of effect holds a group of creatures with Hit Dice (or levels) totaling a number greater than the caster's experience level, the caster decides the order in which the creatures are affected. Unused Hit Dice or levels are lost.\n\nFor example, a 14th level druid casts unwilling wood into a target area containing a giant with 12 Hit Dice and two 3rd level warriors. The druid can transform either the giant or two warriors, but not all three.\n\nEach creature affected is allowed a saving throw vs. polymorph. The spell mutates all those failing their saving throw, along with any items they carry. A new tree has a height of 5 feet per level (or Hit Die) of the creature. The effect is permanent; a creature transformed into a tree ages as a tree and dies as a tree. However, affected beings retain awareness, memories, personality, and intelligence. Only damage severe enough to kill the tree can kill an unwilling wood creature.\n\nTree-characters can return to normal if a spell-caster of greater level than the original caster uses remove curse. The original caster can release a transformed entity at will.\n\nThe material components are a bit of tree root and the caster's holy symbol.\n\nNotes: Uncommon spell for druids"

Within the mist, visibility is reduced to 10 yards and movement is reduced by 25%. Each round a creature spends within the mist, it loses 1d4 hit points from chill damage (no save, but magic such as resist cold halves damage) and must make a Constitution check or lose 1 point of Strength.\n\nThe fog travels at MV 9 over any and all terrain. It can follow simple instructions such as “pursue the dwarves on the hill, “ but it does so with no real intelligence (if the pursued party splits up, the member(s) followed is randomly determined) and it has no special detection abilities (it cannot follow invisible creatures, for example).\n\nFor every 10 points of damage inflicted by the mist, the priest regains 1 hit point (normal maximum cannot be exceeded). For every 5 points of Strength drained, the priest regains 1 hit point in the same way.\n\nFor every creature slain by the mist, whether by cumulative hit point loss or Strength reduced to zero, the priest gains a surge of energy; this can be used to cast cure light wounds on any creature touched, but this healing must be used within 3 rounds or the effect is lost. Any creature slain by the vampiric mist becomes a juju zombie under the control of the priest unless a save vs. death magic is successful.\n\nThe vampiric mist may be destroyed by a spell such as gust of wind, but it is allowed a saving throw vs. spell at the level of the priest casting the spell to avoid such destruction. It can be dispelled in the normal manner.\n\nThe mist cannot be struck with weapons or physically damaged with spells such as lightning bolt, although a suitable fire-based spell (fireball, etc.) may dissipate and destroy the mist unless it makes a successful saving throw vs. spell at the level of the priest who created it. Normal fires do not affect the mist, nor do they prevent the chilling and damaging effect of the spell on creatures within the area of effect.\n\nFinally, Strength points lost from exposure to a vampiric mist are regained at a rate of one per hour after escaping the mist.\n\nNotes: Granted by Iuz the Evil of the Greyhawk setting."

Damage usually can be healed only by natural means – rest and time. However, the underlying magic that prevents the wounds from healing can be removed by an entire elixir of life or a cure disease from a 9th level caster. After either measure is employed, the impediment to magical healing is removed.\n\nThe material component is a poisonous sludge of venoms and other noxious ingredients that are smeared on the blade during the casting.\n\nNotes: Granted by the drow god Selvetarm."

To cast the spell, an effigy worth at least 500 gp must be constructed of the subject.\n\nSince the effigy must be realistic, the sculptor must be quite familiar with the subject.

An oil worth 10 gp per level of the caster must then be applied to the doll and the cleric. The available effects of the spell vary with the level of the caster (these are identical to the spell resembled, unless otherwise specified, see table).\n\nThe caster is aware of the results. If “coma” is indicated, the subject must make a successful saving throw vs. death magic or fall into a coma, taking one 1 point of damage per day thereafter. Unless dispel magic, exorcise, remove curse, dispel evil, limited wish, or wish is used successfully, the subject will eventually die without regaining consciousness.\n\nNotes: Restricted to barbarian clerics, very rare.

On the outside, it initially appears as rough, purple-brown stone. The caster and priests of the same faith can freely move through the wall as though it did not exist. If any other creature (except when in physical contact with a living, mobile priest of Ghaunadaur) touches this plain wall, four tentacles emerge to grasp the being and begin a loud hissing and champing noise to alert the clergy to the presence of an intruder.\n\nThe wall can extrude twenty 16-foot long tentacles, and two beaks. These shift about its surface but can make only four attacks per round against any single opponent. Only the tentacles attack initially; the beaks are saved for a second stage of continued attack or resistance (see below); only the tentacles attack initially. Each tentacle strike inflicts physical damage, and the creature struck must make a successful saving throw vs. spell or be held (as if by a hold person spell). Affected beings get a saving throw to break free of the hold effect (only one save, regardless of how many tentacle strikes are suffered). While held, subjects are attacked by other tentacles at a +2 bonus to hit, and dragged 4 feet closer to the wall per round. Severing a tentacle automatically breaks its hold and causes it to vanish. A tentacle is severed if it takes more than 12 points of damage in a single round.\n\nOnce at the wall, the beaks can attack. The poison of the beaks is debilitative; it takes effect in 2d4 rounds and reduces all ability scores by half for its duration. All appropriate adjustments to attack rolls, damage, Armor Class and so on resulting from the poison apply. Further, the individual's movement is reduced by half and cannot heal by normal or magical means until the poison is neutralized or 3d4 days have passed.\n\nThe material components are any sort of snake, living or dead, and the beak from an octopus or an avian.\n\nNotes: Granted by the drow deity Ghaunadaur. This spell should not be confused with the warding spell tentacle wall."

        "Introduction": "This spell is cast to include two to six different surfaces located within a 1-mile-radius sphere, all of which must be touched and outlined with burning incense by the caster during the casting of the spell as in the 3rd level priest glyph of warding spell. Wandering glyphs creates two glyphs of the same type as those created by a glyph of warding spell; the glyphs have all of the properties of normal glyphs of warding save that the caster cannot trigger and is immune to all effects of his or her own glyphs of warding. In addition, wandering glyphs are not stationary. They can move by themselves to one of the up to six different surfaces touched during casting, though they can never both be in the same place. (If less than six spots are touched, less than six are utilized.)\n\nThe time required to cast the spell is equal to the time required to trace the areas desired to be protected by the glyphs. This time is equal to 1 round for every 5 square feet of area to be protected. A caster can protect at each of up to six locations an area equal to a square the sides of which are equal to his or her level in feet. The casting cannot exceed 8 hours.\n\nWandering glyphs stay at specified surfaces until triggered to go to others or move about from designated surface to surface at random. Nonrandom appearance sequences and conditions are set at the time of the spell's casting and cannot later be changed. Triggered glyphs deal their usual damage to intruders activating them and are spent in so doing. A wandering glyph spell is not ended by the discharge of only one of its glyphs, and the glyphs can be commanded to keep apart during casting, so that only one ever appears in a given location. The expenditure of all glyphs in a wandering glyph spell ends the spell.\n\nThe six surfaces (often doors) set during spell-casting become “sensors” for the spell. The glyphs of warding can be called to a locale when one of the surfaces designated by the spell detects either the approach of a creature of a certain alignment; the discharge of magic in an adjacent area that is not from the caster; or the approach of any creature that does not bear a certain token, wear a certain uniform or badge, or speak a certain password.\n\nThe material components are enough incense to trace the areas to be protected, a drop of holy (or unholy) water for each location, and a black opal worth at least 250 gp. If any location to be protected exceeds 50 square feet, the locations must also be sprinkled with at least 2,000 (total) gp worth of powdered diamond.\n\nNotes: Rare spell from the Forgotten Realms setting, recorded by Volo."

This takes 1d6 rounds. (Note: the clairsentient effect works normally, independent of circumstances: for instance, it works even if the item is concealed.

A serpentine mass of water that obeys the caster's wishes, biting at foes as directed. Although the “serpent” is not a sentient force, the magic compels it to follow moving targets and continue to obey a set task until its caster changes the commands governing it, so that it appears to fight or act independently of the caster's supervision.\n\nA water serpent can rise up (to a maximum of 18 feet above the water surface) and strike at targets of the caster's choosing with a “bite” of crushing water that deals 3d8 points of damage, and strikes twice per round. The serpent is AC 1, MV swim 18, has SS hit points (dealing it more damage than that total causes it to collapse, ending the spell), and a TH ACO of 11. It cannot coil around, constrict, or tail-slap foes, being an actual “growth” of the water rather than a whole-bodied creature, but it can batter at wharves, boats, walls, and other solid objects within its reach, forcing “crushing blow” saving throws against all such items if the items are free to move (for example, if they are floating), at a -1 penalty if they are solid and immobile, and at a -2 penalty if they are composed of separate elements, such as the bricks or stones of a mortared wall or the tree-trunks of a wharf piling. It can deliver two such blows per round, or a blow and an attack (at a target creature). Attacks on creatures do not force crushing blow saving throws on worn or carried items.\n\nUnlike the similar Umberlant spell water wyvern, a water serpent cannot be used as a steed. Nevertheless, it can be used (but only by its caster) in a single thrust that picks up the caster and propels him or her forward to a maximum of 60 feet and upward to a maximum of 20 feet. This drive can be precisely aimed, but is not stable enough to\n\npermit spellcasting en route and provides no protection for the caster at the end of the movement. (When the serpent recoils and collapses, it ends the spell and leaves the caster moving forward with the same momentum as the thrust, and, perhaps, nothing beneath him or her.)\n\nSuch a thrust is made at MV 18, and can project beyond the body of water out of which the serpent was created. It is typically used to deposit the caster on a balcony, atop a wall, or on some other height clear of the water.\n\nIf the creator of a water serpent wills the spell to end, or the serpent passes beyond spell range, it instantly melts away, slumping back into the surrounding waters as the magic dissipates. The caster can freely cast other spells after creating a water serpent, but cannot change its directives in any round in which he or she is spellcasting. A water serpent must always be directed to attack a specific target, not multiple ones. If one is told to strike at “anything that enters through that doorway,” it attacks the first creature to do so and ignore all others, even after its quarry is dead. If told to attack “all creatures entering through that doorway,” it attacks only the first one to do so.\n\nThe material components are two fangs from any sort of aquatic creature equipped with sharp teeth (not cartilage or bony ridges, but true teeth).\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil sea goddess Umberlee of the Forgotten Realms setting. This spell is found only in a few exceptionally rare tomes."

A trapped creature can escape by attempting a second save at a -6 penalty.\n\nFriendly creatures outside the pool add +1 to the creature's save every round, and are in no danger of being sucked under themselves once the trap has been sprung.

A wyvern like mass of water is created, though it must be emphasized the term is based on shape resemblance. The spell only shapes unintelligent water and sets it to a task – it does not create a sentient or aware monster.\n\nA water wyvern can rise up (to a maximum of 12 feet above the water surface) and strike at targets of the caster's choosing with a “bite” of crushing water that inflicts 2d8 points of damage, and strikes once per round. It is AC 3, MV swim 12, has 33 hit points (dealing it more damage than that total causes it to collapse, ending the spell), and has a THAC0 of 13. The size of the “wyvern” created may vary, but its useful properties do not.\n\nThe caster of a water wyvern can choose to ride upon it or direct it to carry others. As a steed, the water wyvern achieves a wet solidity, surging along under the creatures it bears like a galloping horse. It forms a stable platform for the casting of swift, simple spells (those requiring no material components other than a holy symbol or surrounding water and with a casting time of 5 or less). If the “wyvern” carries only one rider (a single creature, plus worn or carried gear, of less than 300 pounds total weight), it can use its bite attack as directed by the caster. If it carries two or more creatures or more than 300 pounds weight, it can be only a mobile platform and has no attacks. A water wyvern can carry a maximum of two creatures, or three if one is its caster.\n\nNo one but its caster can stop or steer a “wyvern.” It will only bite as directed by the caster – but as long as the caster is within range, the caster need not be riding it or in direct contact with it to command it.\n\nIf the creator of a water wyvern undertakes any other spellcasting or wills the “wyvern” to cease to exist, it instantly melts away, slumping back into the surrounding waters as the magic dissipates.\n\nThe material components are a tooth from any sort of animal, and three scales from any aquatic creature.\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil sea goddess Umberlee of the Forgotten Realms setting. This spell is found only in a few exceptionally rare tomes."

The subject remains aware of his surroundings and is able to move under his own power (though he must remain in water) for the duration of the spell. An unwilling creature is allowed a saving throw to resist the effect.\n\nThe watery individual moves at a rate of one mile per round regardless of the movement, speed, or conditions of the body of water; the creature would move across a still pond or upstream during a thunderstorm at the same rate.\n\nThe subject can use ground water to pass through seemingly dry areas. A creature that seeps into the ground or passes from a river or pond into the ground water moves one-half mile per round.\n\nRegardless of the depth of the ground water, the watery creature retains a general sense of direction.

Ships caught in the wave spell's area of effect must make a seaworthiness check to avoid capsizing, though at a +30% bonus at 1st level; this bonus decreases by 5% per level thereafter, so that normal seaworthiness checks are made for a wave cast by a 7th level sea-priest. The -5% penalty is applied for every level after 7th level as well, so a seaworthiness check is made at a -20% penalty against an 11th level sea-priest's wave, which is 11 feet high and travel for 390 feet on the sea. The wave causes 1 point of damage per level of the caster to any land-based being struck by it if the wave rolls overland, but it causes no damage to swimmers on the open sea.\n\nWave spells are unaffected by sea or weather conditions. Thus, a wave can be made to run at a right angle to or completely counter to the direction of any other waves. Wave spells affect the surface of the water only and have no more effect on underwater creatures than naturally occurring waves.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for Sea priests; otherwise, very rare."

Thereafter, that weapon is +5 on the first attack and damage roll against that particular foe. The weapon is considered a magical one for the purposes of striking creatures that can be hit only by magical weapons. The effects of the weapon bless are not additive with those of already magical weapons, i.e. if cast upon a +2 weapon, the effect is still +5, not +7.

For example, a wooden club cannot be turned into a steel short sword, though a steel short sword could be transformed into a steel club. Likewise, a quarterstaff could be transformed into a short bow, as they are of similar size.\n\nThird, weapons that carry a magical dweomer, even if it is only temporary (for example, Nystul's magic aura, light, etc.) cannot be affected by this spell. Casting it on a magical weapon simply wastes the spell.\n\nFourth, the transformed weapon receives no bonuses to attack or damage rolls, nor is it able to strike creatures that can be hit only by magical weapons.

        "Introduction": "The potent spell allows the priest to call directly on the Weave to fashion nonliving matter out of magic or to reshape existing matter. Given enough time and energy, nearly any object can be created or shaped. Once the shaping is completed, the magical energy fades in a short time, leaving the finished matter permanently in the desired form; at this point it is unaffected by dispel magic, Mordenkainen's disjunction and similar effects.\n\nWhile there is no hard and fast limit on the amount of matter that can be created or shaped by a weavesong, several practical limits exist. First, the casting time of weavesong is one turn per pound of organic material, one hour per pound of earth or stone, and one day per pound of metal or gemstone created or shaped by means of this spell. Second, for every day (round up) spent creating or shaping matter by means of this spell, the priest's Constitution temporarily drops by one point. If the Constitution of the priest ever drops to zero, the strain of the weavesong crafting is too much and the priest's spirit passes on. Constitution points return at a rate of one point per two days once the weavesong is ended. Finally, upon completion of the weavesong, the cast must make three successful ability checks. First, the caster must make a successful Constitution check (against initial score at the time of casting) reflecting the tremendous strain required to hold the weavesong together until the item coalesces. Second, the caster must make a successful Wisdom check, reflecting the tremendous willpower necessary to harness the energies of the Weave. Third, the priest must make a successful Artistic Ability nonweapon proficiency check in the medium worked. A priest who lacks this nonweapon proficiency altogether must check against one-third of his or her Wisdom score (round down). A priest who has the Artistic Ability proficiency, but has not specialized in working in a medium employing the created or shaped material must check against two-thirds of the Wisdom score (round down). If stabilities from Player's Option: Skills & Powers are used, the required checks are made against Fitness, Willpower, and Intuition, respectively.\n\nIf the weavesong succeeds, any matter so created or shaped is permanent, indistinguishable from other matter. If the weavesong fails for any reason (whether it be because the caster was forced to end the spell prematurely, because the Constitution of the priest dropped to zero, or because one or more ability checks were failed), the created matter appears briefly, but does not coalesce. It immediately dissipates into magical energy once again; likewise, shaped matter briefly assumes the new shape before reverting to its prior form. A failed casting has a 10% chance of a magical backlash. The backlash erupts as a spherical burst of pure magical energy centered on the priest with a radius of 10 feet for each 100 pounds of material (round up) that the priest attempted to create or shape. Any creature caught in the area of effect suffers 10d10 points of damage. There is no saving throw against such a backlash, and the only protections against this damage are magic resistance or being in a dead\n\nmagic zone or an antimagic field. Only the first protects the caster; obviously a weavesong cannot be cast in a dead magic zone or an antimagic field.\n\nWeavesong can be cast as a cooperative magic spell, greatly increasing the amount of matter that can be created or shaped and the likelihood of success. If cast by two or more priests, the amount of matter that can be created or shaped in any period of time is multiplied by the number of participants. The Constitution score regulating the maximum length of the casting time is the sum of the Constitution ability scores of the participants. Temporarily lost points of Constitution are apportioned equally among the participants according to the percentage of Constitution points they contributed to the total pool. Ability checks are made against the best score of any of the participants. Finally, the chance of a magical backlash is reduced by 1% (to a minimum of 5%) for each additional participant beyond the first.\n\nThe material components are the caster's holy symbol and a small amount of the material to be created.\n\nThe latter “seeds” the Weave so that the ambient magical energies coalesce into the desired material. Shaped matter naturally serves as its own material component. If matter from a single Elemental, Para-Elemental or Quasi-Elemental plane is used as the material component, it is possible to create or shape matter with the purity of that found on the various Inner Planes.\n\nNotes: Very rare spell from the Forgotten Realms setting."

      "sections": {
        "Introduction": "By use of this spell, a priest causes a large whirlpool to come into being. The spell is effective against both surface and underwater creatures and objects. The spell requires the use of a specially constructed ball of shark's teeth that is 1 foot in diameter. The ball is taken to the appropriate depth (10 feet for every level of the spellcaster) or is placed on the sea floor or ocean bottom if the depth is insufficient. The whirlpool spell is then cast, and the ball of teeth begins to rotate, slowly picking up speed with every rotation. Once the spell is cast, the ball stays in place and cannot be moved. The ball rotates for two turns before the whirlpool forms (the two turns count against the spell's duration). The caster has these two turns to get out of the area of effect, or may be caught in the whirlpool.\n\nThe whirlpool has a radius of 100 feet, plus another 10 feet per level of the spellcaster. The center of the whirlpool, called the vortex, is 1 foot wide per level of the spellcaster at the surface, narrowing to 1 foot wide just above the ball; the vortex is 10 feet deep per level of the spell-caster. If the ball has not been placed deep enough in the water, or if the water is of insufficient depth and the ball is placed on the ocean floor, the depth of the vortex is shortened accordingly. If the ball is placed too deep, the vortex fills with water immediately after forming and the whirlpool collapses on itself and is destroyed. When the spell's duration expires, the ball of shark's teeth disintegrates and the whirlpool collapses in on itself and disappears in one round.\n\nAnything entering the area of effect is inexorably drawn into the vortex of the whirlpool in one turn. Movement is in a spiraling fashion at a rate of 12. Once in the vortex, ships and underwater vessels must make seaworthiness checks to avoid capsizing; apply a -5% penalty to such checks for every level of the spellcaster above 11th level. Those caught in the vortex suffer 1d6 points of damage per round from battering.\n\nSwimmers and ships can fight the pull of the whirlpool's current, but their movement rate must exceed 12 to escape. To determine how long a swimmer or ship can fight the whirlpool's current, deduct the swimmer's or ship's movement rate from the whirlpool's movement rate (12), then divide the whirlpool's movement rate by this number for the time in rounds. For example, a human with a swimming rate of 6 is caught in a whirlpool. The swimmer will be drawn into the vortex in two rounds (12-6=6, 12+6 =2). A swimmer whose movement rate exceeds 12 can avoid being pulled into the whirlpool.\n\nSwimmers and ships with a maximum movement rate of 12 make no progress and only keep themselves the same distance from the vortex. Swimmers can swim at full speed against the whirlpool's current for four rounds, after which they must make a Constitution check every round. A swimmer who fails a Constitution check is considered exhausted and can do nothing but keep his head above water until the whirlpool takes him under. Ships with a maximum movement rate of 12 hold their own against the whirlpool for five turns. After that time, a seaworthiness check must be made at -10% per turn in the whirlpool. This check reflects the growing exhaustion of the sailors and rowers as they fight the whirlpool's current. If a seaworthiness check is failed, it means the sailors and rowers have collapsed with exhaustion and can do nothing more.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for Sea priests otherwise, very rare. (Updated from Dragon Magazine.)\n\nReferences: For swimmers, see the swimming rules (pages 120-121 of the PHB); for ships, see the information on ocean voyaging (page 126 of the DMG)."

        "Introduction": "This spell shapes existing water (no matter how agitated) into a tunnel like that formed by large “breakers” rolling into a shore. This cylinder of water is up to 300 yards long, contains breathable air, and has “solid” walls that will not collapse or spray water on creatures inside, although they can freely reach through the curving water, pierce it with weapons, and even grasp things and pull them through the walls and into the tunnel. A whirlwave tunnel can be traversed as if one is walking on solid ground, and even if cast in a storm, both the water and the air within it are calm and immobile.\n\nThe tunnel forms in the direction its caster is facing, beginning around him or at any distance within spell range, and either runs straight away from the caster or, if the caster desires, curves toward a desired destination he visualizes. (That is, the caster must have seen it previously, even if darkness or weather prevents seeing it at the time of casting. The caster cannot merely aim for a harbor or an island he suspects is present.) The caster can choose to “anchor” the tunnel, which makes it immobile despite external forces such as tidal waves, gales, and the like. He could otherwise elect to make it mobile so that it is swept along by the surrounding waters. The latter use of the tunnel usually serves to bring sailors ashore, or most of the way toward shore, from a shipwreck or a naval battle.\n\nA whirlwave tunnel continues only so long as there is water around it. It cannot be longer than the body of water, though it can otherwise be as long as the caster desires, to its length limit of 300 yards. The magic prevents water from flooding the tunnel through its open ends, but fails, causing a tunnel collapse, if struck by part water or similar magic of equal or greater level that serves to shape water. Persistent attacks on a tunnel by a water weird, water elemental, or other creature partially composed of liquid water (as opposed to creatures that merely live in the water, such as sharks or octopuses) can also cause its collapse if they inflict a cumulative total of 66 points of damage in a single 10-foot spot or area. The use of any fire-related magic within the tunnel (even spells cast into the open ends, such as fireballs) also causes its instant collapse, although the two spells will cancel each other rather than visiting fiery damage on creatures in the tunnel (they still suffer damage from the collapse itself)-\n\nA whirlwave tunnel can be created that bends or slopes up or down from the horizontal, and its “floor” is not slippery. Thus, a caster can use this spell to create a climbing chute (but not a slide) within a waterfall and curve safely through a plunge pool at the bottom of the fall or to thrust safely through a whirlpool or maelstrom.\n\nA whirlwave tunnel protects creatures inside it as follows: No normal missile can penetrate its walls. Weapons wielded directly from the outside (for instance, by aquatic creatures), spells cast from the outside, and objects penetrating from outside (such as ships or rocks that come into contact with a mobile whirlwave tunnel) can all pass freely through the walls of the tunnel, with one exception: The swirling waters of the walls prevent clear sight of creatures inside the tunnel by observers more than 10 feet distant, so spells requiring clear vision of the target are affected.\n\nAny number of creatures can pass along a whirl-wave tunnel before it expires, at their normal movement rates. Those still in the tunnel when it collapses, or passing bodily through the tunnel walls, suffer 5d4 points of battering damage (per passage).\n\nThe material component is a piece of wire or glue-stiffened thread formed into a hollow spiral (like a metal spring). Also, some of the water is consumed by the spell. (If this spell is cast in a shallow wading pool, the magic works, but it nearly empties the pool in the process.) That this magic does not protect beings in the tunnel from acids, poisons, or other harmful effects in the water itself.\n\nNotes: Granted by the evil sea goddess Umberlee of the Forgotten Realms setting. This spell is found only in a few exceptionally rare tomes."

The spell can divert a creature from its goal for an extended time without physically harming it. If the wind changes between east and west, the creature's distinction between good and evil alters. Wind that varies between north and south alters its attitude towards law and chaos. In absolutely calm conditions, the creature becomes true neutral. The creature behaves normally from moment to moment and suffers no obvious harm such as starvation or confusion, but cannot pursue a given goal for long without changing its mind. The general direction of the wind usually changes every two hours, and often more frequently. The DM chooses the wind direction either randomly or based on whatever behavior change seems most dramatic or entertaining. Magically altered wind direction can also change the creature's attitudes. The speed of the wind has no effect on this spell.\n\nThe spell requires a set of wooden dicing sticks, which are reusable.\n\nNotes: Uncommon for priests of the Dark Sun setting."

        "Introduction": "This spell is “the highest gift of Lolth,” granted rarely even to favored drow. It is a special form of animate dead, which enables the caster to create a special sort of zombie, known as a spirit-wraith. Imbued with the skills (hit points. Armor Class, and THAC0) it had in life, this creation is telepathically linked to – and controlled by – the caster of this spell, usually a drow matron mother.\n\nThis spell may not be instantaneously granted, or may be denied entirely, at Lolth's will. It is granted only for the completion of specific tasks, and these may never be purely to work revenge or bring harm on other drow. Failure in the task brings on the disfavor of Lolth.\n\nZin-carla involves the forcible return of a departed soul or spirit to its body. Only through the willpower and exacting, sleepless control of the caster are the undead being's desired skills kept separate from unwanted memories and emotions. The duration of the spell is limited by the needs of the task, the patience of Lolth, and the mental limits of the caster – for a total loss of control usually means failure.\n\nSo long as that control is maintained, the spirit-wraith cannot tire or be distracted from its task. It does not feel pain or disability, and will continue to function as long as it remains mobile.\n\nA spirit-wraith cannot be made to cast spells without losing control over its mind entirely. It can fully use combat and craft skills possessed in life. If control is lost, the spirit-wraith becomes a revenant, driven by hatred and the memory of its violation at the hands of the spellcaster. Uncontrolled spirit-wraiths do not stop until the zin-carla caster is destroyed.\n\nA spirit-wraith driven to do something against its old nature has a chance of breaking free of its control (treat as a charm spell, with the same saving throw as in life). For example, one cannot successfully use this undead to destroy a being that it loved in life.\n\nSpell-like natural powers (such as the levitation ability of drow) are retained, and can be used by, the undead. The spirit-wraith can use its former experience and memories, as much as allowed by the linked caster. Both the zombie and the caster are immune to the effects of spells that attack the mind, and similar spell-like powers (such as the mental blast of a mind flayer). It knows wariness, anger, glee, hatred, frustration, and triumph, but not fear. It cannot be controlled by the spells and priestly powers normally used to command encountered undead – and control of it cannot thereby be wrested away from the caster of the zin-carla.\n\nSpirit-wraiths do not breathe, but can speak (if allowed to do so by their controller). They can utter command and activation words, and the controlling caster can speak through them directly, but spell incantations will have no effect if uttered by the undead.\n\nTo stop a spirit-wraith, it must be physically destroyed – if it is still able to even crawl, it will do so, tirelessly, searching for a way to complete its task.\n\nThe material component is a treasured object that belonged to the body to be controlled. If the corpse is badly decomposed or not whole, other spells (such as Nulathoe's ninemen) and magical unguents will also be required, to restore it to whole, supple condition.\n\nWizards and other powerful creatures (such as mind flayers, aboleth, or cloakers) that raid or despoil drow cities can expect to face either a full-scale attack – or a spirit-wraith or two.\n\nNotes: Rarely granted by the drow goddess Lolth."

        "Introduction": "Under certain circumstances, priests of Avani can use the healing power of the sun to revive injured or fallen friends.\n\nThis spell can be cast only during daylight and lasts until the sun sets. In the Khinasi climate, this spell can last 12 to 16 hours. In other parts of Cerilia, the duration may be significantly shorter (during a Vosgaard winter, daylight may last only eight hours).\n\nWhen cast, the sunlight of Avani shines brightly, even through cloud cover (even magically summoned or created clouds), and confers healing on the bodies of anyone within 100 yards of the caster. For the magic to work, two conditions must be met: Those to be healed must be exposed to the sunlight (the priest or his allies may have to drag fallen comrades into the sunlight), and those to be healed must be worshipers of Avani or otherwise designated by the priest. This prevents the priest's enemies from being healed unless the priest so desires.\n\nAvani's resuscitation is an extremely powerful healing spell. While it lasts, all affected beings heal at a rate of one hit point per turn. The healing sunlight also acts as cure blindness, cure disease, and performs similar physical healing. The spell cannot cure certain magical afflictions; it cannot restore lost levels or remove curses.\n\nAvani's spell can even raise dead and regenerate. As long as the sun has not set on a dead or maimed character, the spell restores lives or limbs at the last light of the day. Restored individuals need not make System Shock rolls because of Avani's direct influence. An individual raised from the dead by this spell has 1 hit point at sunset.\n\nThis spell does not affect elves, though half-elves who believe in the human pantheon may be healed. Dwarves and halflings may be healed if they are allied to Avani or the casting priest. Orogs, humanoids, and other nonhumans seldom benefit from Avani's power – only those who have allied themselves with Avani's servants stand a chance of receiving the healing gift. Other creatures may be healed at the DM's discretion.\n\nNotes: Granted by Avani of Cerilia, the Birthright setting."

As a spy, it can fly anywhere a bird can normally go and can relay information to its master upon its return by speaking in a voice understandable only to the priest. It can answer questions about its spy mission, but it cannot make judgments or perform extrapolations from existing information.\n\nThe bird also has the ability to locate and steal small objects. The daythief can carry an object in its claws or beak up to three times its own weight and still fly to its master. The bird can be sent to steal specific objects, or might steal things on its own that its master might find useful. It cannot use its uncanny intelligence or magical speech to explain why it steals a particular object.\n\nThe daythief cannot be captured or harmed. It is said that Eloele protects her holy bird or replaces destroyed daythieves with new birds to serve her faithful priests.

The animals are unable to understand commands or the individual's needs and desires.\n\nIf the subject was dying of thirst in the desert, for example, local animals would try to lead him or her to water. If the subject was starving, they might bring food. If the subject was under attack, all natural beasts in the area would do their best to defend him or her.\n\nIn addition, natural animals cannot be compelled to act against the affected individual.

The spell temporarily summons the spirit of a dead champion of Haelyn.\n\nThe champion, invisible and noncorporeal, will stay with the priest for the duration of the spell, answering questions and giving advice when needed.\n\nThis “invisible adviser\" draws on the wisdom it gained during its life and its afterlife. It should be considered a specialist – a sage in regard to one sphere of knowledge specified during the casting of the spell. The adviser might be an expert on combat, war, law, Anuirean history, or any field related to the worship of Haelyn.\n\nThe adviser probably won't be knowledgeable concerning things out of its area of expertise. For example, a priest of Haelyn might summon an invisible adviser to help her plan a large battle. That adviser can provide splendid advice regarding the deployment of troops, the logistics of supply, and activity on the battlefield. The adviser will be less helpful regarding personal combat, and of nearly no use regarding decisions of law or economics.\n\nThe duration of the spell depends on Haelyn's wishes. Usually, the adviser remains throughout the current crisis. If the adviser was summoned to help with the planning and execution of a particular battle, the spirit stays until the battle ends. As a general rule, the spell seldom lasts more than a month.\n\nHaelyn may call back the spirit if he thinks the adviser has been misused or the priest is letting the spirit make decisions. The adviser is meant only to supplement the wisdom and knowledge of the casting priest, as if it were a powerful augury or speak with dead spell. If the casting priest abuses or misuses the advice given by the spirit, Haelyn will first warn the priest, then recall the adviser.\n\nNotes: Granted by Haelyn of Cerilia, the Birthright setting."

        "Introduction": "Legends tell that only the most powerful High Priestess of Kriesha will ever be granted the use of this quest spell. However, the legends also say that she may be granted this spell several times during her career.\n\nWhen this spell is cast, the priestess specifies a single individual who she has personally seen at least once. This individual is often a hero of an enemy faith. The casting priest then specifies a particular quest in which that hero is currently engaged. The spell then takes its hideous affect.\n\nAs long as the hero remains on the specified quest, he or she is subject to all the effects of a curse spell (reversed remove curse), as well as other misfortunes (bad weather, attacks of wild animals, and so on) the DM wishes to enforce. The spell works in devious ways, making the victim's life extremely difficult and dangerous while pursuing the specified quest. If the hero turns aside from the quest, the curse temporarily lifts, making life seem fair and pleasant again.\n\nThis spell is most often invoked when a champion of another faith attempts to hinder or destroy those faithful to Kriesha. The spell's stated intent must be very specific. The cursed quest cannot encompass “any time the character acts against a worshiper of Kriesha,\" but it might work “when the character acts to destroy Kriesha's temples in the province of Lutkhovsky.\"\n\nThe DM must always specify at least one way that the curse can be lifted. The victim of the spell won't know this solution, nor will the casting priest. However, the power of the other gods may try to provide hints to the victim as a means of balancing the power of the spell. Suggested ways of removing Kriesha's cursed quest include:\n\nSlaying the caster of the spell;\n\nFinding a holy relic of one of Cerilia's other deities to use as protection;\n\nDestroying a holy relic of Kriesha; and\n\nPerforming an important and dangerous task to win another god's favor (and protection).\n\nNotes: Granted by Kriesha of Cerilia, the Birthright setting."

As long as the affected priest puts forth a “friendly\" appearance (using Table 59: Encounter Reactions in the DMG), no creature of sufficient intelligence will react to in a manner worse than “indifferent.\"\n\nThe power of this spell allows priests of Laerme to attempt impossible missions in the field of diplomacy. A priest influenced by this spell could safely travel through an elven or awnshegh realm, knowing that no intelligent creature – even the awnshegh – will attack him as long as the priest maintains a friendly, helpful attitude. In addition, a normally unreasonable or evil character will at least consider what the priest has to say, rather than dismissing pleas or arguments out of hand.\n\nThis spell does not charm creatures into helping or obeying the priest. It will not magically stop an attack in progress or provide the priest with cover so he or she can enter an enemy's realm and assassinate the ruler. Should the priest do anything, or allow his or her allies to do anything, that would compromise the integrity of the magic, Laerme withdraws her protection immediately.\n\nThe spell's magic usually lasts for the duration of a particular mission. This might mean several days of travel through different realms, or it could mean one audience with a powerful individual. The spell usually expires after a month, unless the priest has not yet accomplished the mission.\n\nNotes: Granted by Laerme of Cerilia, the Birthright setting."

The spell directly affects the casting priest, allowing him to tap the magical energy of a single province. He must remain within the same province for the duration of the spell (as soon as he leaves its boundaries, the spell ends). He is able to cast realm spells as if the unclaimed source holdings in the area were temple holdings under his control. The priest can then cast any realm spell he knows, using the mebhaighl as a source holding.\n\nExample: Ruorlen, a 15th level priest, has fled his enemies to Cariele – specifically, the province of Mountainsedge (3/4). Currently, the only source holding in the province is a source (0) held by the Eyeless One. Ruorlen, who has been granted mebhaighl touch, can cast it to tap mebhaighl as the equivalent of a temple (4) holding. Over the next three months, Ruorlen can cast as many as three realm spells in Mountainsedge that require a holding level of 4 or less.\n\nNotes: Granted by Ruornil of Cerilia, the Birthright setting.\n\nOptional: Realm spells are beyond the scope of this book, which limits the usefulness of this spell as an option, the DM might treat this spell as a one-time limited wish in areas that are not magic dead, and as a full wish in areas of wild magic, mythal, or other exceptionally strong magic."

The affected unit is not immune to routs, but it becomes much braver in the face of the enemy. The spell also grants the unit a -4 bonus to all unit saving throws.\n\nThe warlords of Cuiraecen are an imposing sight. Thunder and lightning strike behind and above them, and sparks fly when they wield their weapons. The voice of Cuiraecen moves them to great deeds of glory, and his power flows through their limbs. The very sight of them is sometimes enough to make weak units flee the battlefield in terror.\n\nNotes: Granted by Cuiraecen of Cerilia, the Birthright setting."

The avians aid the caster by whatever means they possess, staying until a fight is over, a specific mission is finished, the caster is safe, or he or she sends them away.

In Hurd's case, adventuring parties returned back to his tower with all of the treasure they found and gave him his agreed-upon share.

The material components are a sheet of vellum inscribed with the adventurers' names (common), a permanent magical item given to the group's leader (exotic), a small ruby (100 gp value) given to each creature affected, one pound of giant bee honey, and a few drops of oil of slipperiness (rare components).

        "Introduction": "This is essentially the 10th-level version of dispel magic. As noted in the spell statistics, there are two different versions of this spell; the second is referred to as Nazzer's nullification cloak. Both spells share some common elements, however.\n\nOnce cast, all spells and spell-like effects in the area of effect have a chance to be dispelled. Unless noted otherwise, it functions as the 3rd-level wizard spell dispel magic.\n\nSpells of levels 1–9 have a base 100% chance to be dispelled. True dweomers have a base chance of 50% to be dispelled (a roll of 11 or higher on a d20). If the caster of the effect is of higher level than the caster of Nazzer's nullification, subtract one from the chance of success for each level of difference. If the caster of the effect is of lower level, add one to the chance of success for each level of difference. For example, a 25th-level wizard's stoneskin that is the target of this spell cast by a 21st-level wizard would reduce the chance for success to a roll of 15 or higher on a d20. No matter what the adjustments, a roll of 1 is always a failure, and a roll of 20 is always a success.\n\nNazzer's nullification can be cast on a magical item to permanently render the item nonmagical. Most standard magical items are susceptible to this spell, since their effective level is 12th in most instances. Even if not successful, the item is rendered nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. Artifacts are not subject to this effect.\n\nThe material components for this spell are dust from a burned out ioun stone that has been ground to powder, a fire opal worth precisely 1,200 gp, and a dagger of the finest quality (an exceptional weapon). All are rare components.\n\nNazzer's nullification cloak: The secondary version of this spell remains in operation for one full turn after it has been cast, disrupting all magic entering it. Magic within the area of effect at the time the spell is cast is dispelled as described above, but magical items continue to function.\n\nIf a spell succeeds in resisting the dispel, it is immune to the remaining nine rounds' worth of dispelling unless it somehow exits the area of effect and then reenters. All magic that enters the area of effect after the initial round is subject to dispelling.\n\nSpell and spell-like effects cannot be used within the area for the duration of the spell. If the caster is within the area of effect, his spells also fail. Neither version of this spell has a visible effect.\n\nIn addition to the material components detailed above, this spell also requires the dust gathered from an awakened demilich's lair."

The spell persists until the victim retracts the statement.\n\nCreatures with the same alignment as the caster find the victim loathsome in the extreme and cannot bear the victim's presence. They flee, drive away, or belittle the victim as fits the situation. The victim is not actually attacked unless the surrounding creatures would ordinarily be hostile.\n\nThe effect is less severe if the creature's alignment only partially overlaps the caster's. For example, a lawful good caster generates a reduced effect in creatures whose alignments are lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral good, and chaotic good. Such creatures tend to view the victim as a moronic windbag, and they generally refuse to take anything the victim says seriously unless there is overwhelming evidence that the victim is speaking the truth.\n\nThe spell's components are a bud of crushed garlic (common), a vial of giant skunk musk, a lump of harpy dung, the tongue from any giant, poisonous amphibian (rare), the intact pelt of an aurumvorax, and a lock of hair, freely given, from a succubus or lamia (exotic)."

Fast growth can enhance growth in existing thorns to increase damage, grow a vine to greater lengths (up to ten feet), cause a tree to grow ten feet in an hour, or whatever the caster wishes (with the DM's approval). For example, if the dryad wishes to increase the damage potential in a plant, she can use it on a large bramble bush. If someone tries to move through the bush, he suffers 1d4 hp damage for every five feet of bramble. (If used with the shape plant spell, the brambles cause 1d4 + 2 hp damage.) Each time a dryad uses this spell, the plant resists (via saving throw vs. spell at the caster's level) for one simple reason: Fast growth causes the plant to use a lot of resources all at once. If the caster rolls a 20 on the saving throw, the plant dies. If the spell didn't succeed, then the dryad knows that the plant did not have enough resources to grow as she wanted."

The priest must name the type of creature to be abjured. If the creature has a personal name, the priest must speak that as well. The creature's magic resistance, if any, must be checked prior to the determination of the success of the spell. Only if the priest manages to exceed the magic resistance percentage of the creature can the spell possibly affect it.\n\nThe priest then compares his or her level against the Hit Dice of the creature being abjured. The priest has a base 50% chance of affecting the creature. However, if the priest's level is lower than the creature's Hit Dice, the base chance is reduced 2% for each level the priest is below the creature. If the priest's level is greater than the creature's Hit Dice, the base chance is increased 5% for each level of difference. (Note: a creature with an addition of+4 or better to its Hit Dice is treated as 1 Hit Die higher.)\n\nPercentile dice are rolled, if the roll is higher than the one needed to abjure, the creature can attack the priest. However, if the creature wishes to return to its own plane, attack is unlikely.\n\nIf the roll is equal to or less than the percentage chance needed, the creature is driven from the place or person inhabited and returned to its own plane. The creature cannot voluntarily return to the place or person it had previously inhabited, although a magically controlled creature can return if ordered to do so by the person controlling it.\n\nThe reversed spell, implore, entreats some creature from another plane to come to the priest casting the spell.\n\nThe type of creature is named, and its personal name, if any, is spoken by the caster. The creature's magic resistance must first be exceeded on a percentage roll. Then success of the spell is checked, in the same way as for an abjure spell. The success of the spell does not guarantee that the creature will be friendly to the caster, nor does the spell give the caster any control over the creature.\n\nThe material components for the abjure spell are holy (or unholy) water, the priest's holy (or unholy) symbol, and some item despised by the creature. In reversed form, the components are the same, except that the last item must be one that the creature desires."

One cubic foot of lava per round for a number of rounds equal to the caster’s level flows out of the tube. (See The Nature of Lava sidebar for game effects.) If the lava flow is blocked, the tube could burst, causing hot lava to splatter within 100 yards of the tube.

The caster can direct one bolt per round at any target, as per the spell. Bolts cause 3d6 points of damage to one target each, with a saving throw for half damage. Every round that the spell is active, there is a 25% chance that the cloud emits 1d6 lightning balls that roll down to the ground and move randomly at a Movement Rate of 12 for 1d4 rounds each. The lightning balls are eerie blue sizzling masses of light 2-8” in diameter. Creatures touching ball lightning directly must make a successful saving throw vs. death magic at a +2 bonus or suffer 6d8 points of electrical damage and be stunned for 2d6 rounds. The cloud is extremely hazardous to aerial creatures. Any flying creatures in the area of effect (other than elemental-type creatures) must make a successful saving throw vs. paralysis or fall out of the sky. Visibility inside the cloud is practically zero.\n\nThere is no rain associated with this spell, but unusually loud thunder may result. Strong winds disperse the cloud, causing the duration of the spell to be reduced by half. Other than altering the winds, weather control does not affect this spell, since the cloud and lightning are produced by seismic energy instead of normal weather patterns.\n\nThe material components for this spell are flint and tinder, which are struck against a glass bottle filled with volcanic gas.

The spell concentrates these elements (see the Nature of Lava sidebar) and forces them through a field of seismic energy. The result is devastating to cities, towns with brick or stone buildings, or areas under construction. Intense cold, combined with exploding ice and gases, cracks paved surfaces, and sends buildings toppling. Stone constructs must roll a saving throw of 14 or better to survive intact. (See Siege Damage rules in the Dungeon Master Guide.) Earth and wood constructs are not affected. Anyone within the 5-yards field must make a successful saving throw vs. death magic or suffer 2d12 points of damage.\n\nAnyone in the wider area of effect (50 square yards per caster level) has a 30% chance per round of injury from falling rock and debris (2d4 points of damage), and a 40% chance per round of contacting ice lava. Resulting damage is 1d4 points of damage per round from contact. Anyone wearing metal armor suffers double damage, but wearing leather or thick wool reduces the damage by half. Immersion of any bare skin is incredibly dangerous: There is a 10% chance of losing the limb to frostbite if the victim doesn't receive the appropriate treatment or the protection of magical warmth. Full immersion requires a successful System Shock roll; failure indicates that the victim is rendered unconscious for 2 full turns after being removed from the ice lava.

(See the structural damage table, below.) Sometimes metal objects can be found in the ruins if temperatures within the surge were not too high (50% chance for each metal object affected). Earthen or mud constructs simply liquefy. Occasionally cloth is left untouched, the hot gases having moved too fast to burn it.\n\nAbout 25% of pyroclastic surges are gravity-driven pyroclastic flows, where the densest part of the flow hugs the ground and is topped by a dark cloud of fine particles that form a wall. These masses of hot gas and incandescent solid particles are violet-gray and filled with electrical scintillations. Saving throws against these surges are made at a -4 penalty. A reverse gravity spell causes these flows to move in the opposite direction.\n\nThe caster can cause the flow to move in any direction initially, but there is a 5% chance per round that it changes direction randomly. The caster is vulnerable to the effects of this spell but makes saving throws against it at a +2 bonus. Creatures composed of air suffer only 1d2 points of damage per round of exposure. Protective spells like stoneskin still leave the recipient vulnerable to heat damage.

        "Introduction": "This spell changes a specific volume of an element associated with the casting priest into a holy element. The holy element is pure and blessed, a physical manifestation of the elemental priest’s faith and devotion.\n\nTo cast this spell, the priest spends the casting time deep in prayer. He focuses on his holy symbol, praying over a specific quantity of his patron element and contemplating the pure strength of its planar form. At the end of the hour, the priest makes a Wisdom check and plunges his hand and holy symbol into the element (whether earth, air, fire, or water), causing it to become invested with holy power. Note that no harm befalls the priest or the holy item if he rolls a successful Wisdom check; a failed check indicates no damage, with the exception of the fire element, which causes 1d4 points of damage. The prayer must be vocalized throughout the casting, accompanied by distinct hand motions unique to each element. For example, a fire priest’s fingers dance like wild flames, an earth priest makes slow, deliberate motions, a water priest’s hands move with fluid grace, and an air priest’s movements are filled with erratic fluttering.\n\nHoly elements retain their purity and blessed state until they are used. Some priests carry holy elements with them as another sign of their faith, while certain ceremonies require a priest to make use of a holy element. If employed as a weapon against undead or creatures from the Lower Planes, a holy element loses its sacred nature immediately after it is used. See the sidebar on “Holy Elements” for details on using these elements as weapons and for the damage inflicted by them.\n\nThe specific quantities of material altered by this spell are as follows: a palm-sized rock or loose earth that fills a small sack; an amount of fire equal to a torch; six ounces of water. Air, of course, is a special case. Elemental air is the hardest holy element to retain, but it is also the fastest to imbue with sacred power. The elemental air priest must pray as described above, but his casting time is reduced to one full round. At the end of that round, the priest makes a Wisdom check. If successful, the air around the hand holding the holy symbol becomes pure and blessed. It retains this holiness for 1d4 rounds, then returns to its normal state. Any time during this duration, the priest can use the holy air as described above. He holds his hand toward the intended target and softly blows in that direction. The holy air moves like the wind, releasing its sacred power when it strikes a solid object or comes in contact with an incorporeal entity."

The outcome is anything but certain, but the more powerful and charismatic of the two gains power over the lesser.\n\nDragon mastery affects all true dragons, false dragons, wyrm, linnorms, Oriental dragons, wyverns, drakes, and draconians. The spell requires a single dragon scale (of an age at least equal to the target dragon's) and a silver crucible to burn the scale in. The spell has no effect on non-draconic monsters.\n\nWhen the spell is cast, both caster and target must make an immediate Charisma check. The caster subtracts his level as a spellcaster from the roll, and the dragon subtracts its age category (half its hit dice for lesser dragons). If the caster rolls lower, he has mastered the dragon and can command it to undertake whatever actions he likes. (Suicidal actions or actions requiring the dragon to disclose the location of its hoard immediately cancel the spell's effect.) If the dragon rolls lower, it has dominated the caster, and can likewise command him.\n\nIn both cases, the spell lasts as long as an equivalent charm person spell would last, according to the loser's Intelligence and saving throws.

The dweomer upon the words is in no way dispelled; it will activate, as according to the spell, when the document is read normally.\n\nThe document need not be open and apparent; the priest may read the banned letters of a rolled scroll or closed book. However, no special understanding is imparted by the spell, so if the writings are in a language unfamiliar to the caster, he simply sees an image of the script in his mind, nothing more. Thus, a tablet with the confuse languages dweomer (the reverse of comprehend languages) remains unfathomable to the caster.\n\nNote that the casting of this spell also does not ensure that any real information is learned. A cursed scroll may simply be gibberish upon a rolled piece of parchment and would be revealed as such. Also, this spell does not allow the caster to read a passage written with illusionary script.\n\nThe material component for the Priest version of this spell is the caster's holy symbol laid upon the document or object to be read.

The dwarf who keeps time is the leader of the chant and becomes the focus of the chant's magic.

While the priest gains no additional memorized priest spells, the priest may gain access to additional chants that were previously unavailable to him. Upon completing the hammer chant, the group can immediately begin another chant, which then gains the benefit of the increased effective level provided by the hammer chant.\n\nIf a hammer chant is attempted during battle, the chanting dwarves lose all Armor Class bonuses for shield or Dexterity while chanting. If any of them loses his concentration (when struck a blow, or distracted by noise or magic), the hammer chant ends immediately.\n\nThe material components of the hammer chant are a hammer, an anvil, and a forge's fire.

        "Introduction": "When this chant is completed, the affected dwarf gains complete immunity to any normal attack by cut, blow, projectile, or similar impact. Magical weapons and spells still have their normal effect, but all mundane weapons are turned aside.\n\nAccording to some dwarves, objects can also be protected by steelskin chants of longer duration (4d6 hours casting time), but this protection does not apply to an object's wearer or owner. Armor protected by steelskin does not melt in a dragon's breath or crack under a giant's blow, but it provides no additional protection to its wearer.\n\nThe chant blocks 1d3 attacks, plus one attack per three effective levels of the caster. This limit applies regardless of attack rolls; whether the attack would have hit or not, the spell's potency is reduced by one for each possible attack in a round. These attacks inflict no damage on the chant's recipient. The chant's effects last until the chant's recipient is attacked and the magic is invoked. No more than a single steelskin can ever be active on a single dwarf at the same time; repeated castings have no additional effect.\n\nRepeated rumors that a dwarven armorer somewhere has enchanted armor with steelskin have proven false time and again, but the story persists among the gullible. Less scrupulous smiths sometimes sell armor that they claim is protected by this magic. Dwarven priests and smiths seldom employ this chant for the benefit of anyone but dwarves of their own clan.\n\nThe material component of this chant is a pouch of steel filings, which must be scattered over the recipient."

The stokers are dwarves who feed the fires that release metal from ore. This chant allows them to double the heat in their smelter, increasing the speed with which they process ore. All functions of the smelter happen twice as quickly.\n\nWhen used by a cantor of 9th level or higher, the stoker's chant creates a special metal called forge-gold, which a knowledgeable smith can alloy with mithril or even adamantite to make it workable at lower temperatures. Mithril or adamantite alloyed with forge-gold can be worked in an ordinary forge without the need for dragon bellows, silver tongs, or the other specialized tools required for high temperature metalwork.\n\nThe material component is a dragon's fire-sac, the portion of its lungs that generates its breath weapon, shaped into a set of bellows. The component is not consumed by the casting of the chant."

Whenever a blow is struck with a bloodiron blade, it inflicts an additional +2 hp damage by keeping the wounds it causes from closing properly. The spell lasts until the weapon is blooded in combat and then resheathed; if not resheathed after a battle, the bloodiron weapon requires the user to make a Wisdom check every round it is held. If the check fails, the wielder is compelled to attack the nearest living creature, friend or foe.\n\nWounds caused by bloodiron do not regenerate (giving the chant its other name, “trollsbane”). Bloodiron chants have no effect on blunt weapons or on magical weapons of any kind. Dwarves often cast bloodiron on crossbow bolts, creating deep wounds that are difficult to heal. The spell is especially popular among warriors of Abbathor, the dwarven god of greed.\n\nThe material component is the iron to be affected, plus the blood of the lead chanter. Casting bloodiron requires that the forge-priest to cut himself with the weaponed to be enchanted; giving his blood to the bloodiron magic causes 2d8 hp damage to the forge-priest. This damage"

The pech chant summons as many pech as there are miners chanting: no more, and no fewer. The pech triple the mine's output as long as they remain working, and because they are expert miners, no unexpected explosion, flooding, or collapse occurs while the pech assist the dwarves. However, the pech can create a siege tunnel, breach a dam, or engage in combat, if so commanded by the lead cantor. As soon as they finish any destructive stonework, the chant ends and the pech return to the Plane of Earth.\n\nIf the pech are asked to perform only peaceful work, the chant only lasts as long as at least one of the dwarven miners is still chanting; as soon as a dwarf stops chanting he falls asleep. The pech remain by the dwarves' side, working steadily and silently, until the last of the dwarves who chanted them into the mine has fallen asleep. Then they return, unseen, to the Plane of Elemental Earth.\n\nThe material component for a pech chant is a pick-axe made of finest steel and inscribed with runes of dark alloy metal (200 gp)."

Once all questions have been answered, the spirit is free to leave the item at any time. If it has been well-treated, a successful Charisma check by a dwarf of the spirit's clan indicates that the spirit remains in the item for another year. If the spirit is mistreated, it leaves at once. The longer it stays, the more likely it is that the item will display additional powers. For each decade that the item is inhabited, the DM either chooses an ability or rolls on the accompanying table to determine what ability the item gains. If the same result appears more than once, the effect is cumulative. If the item is abandoned, it neither gains nor loses abilities until it is again used.\n\nRecords describing the use of the anneal clan spirit chant indicate that annealed spirits have created other effects as well; the preceding table is only a guide.\n\nEach time an item transfers ownership, the new owner must make a Charisma check. If the check succeeds, the item retains both the annealed spirit and its powers. If the check fails, the annealed spirit leaves the item forever, sometimes leaving behind a single minor power as a sign of its long habitation. Items whose spirits have been bound for long periods of time are revered as holy relics by many dwarves, and a clan will go to great lengths to keep such precious objects in the family. They are never sold or bartered away.\n\nSummoning the spirit of a clan ancestor and chanting it into an item requires the cantor(s) to add a bone of the ancestor to the forge's fire."

This chant permits the creation of magical metal items of up to +1 per two extra slots of the relevant nonweapon proficiency of the master smith. Thus, an armorer with only the base proficiency or one extra slot of proficiency cannot create a masterwork at all. However, an armorer with three slots (two for the base level of skill, plus one extra) of the armorer proficiency can create a suit of chain mail +1, plate mail +1, and so on. For items without “pluses,” a masterwork can yield an item of 1,000 XP value per two extra slots of the relevant nonweapon proficiency (usually blacksmithing). Magical spells that nullify or destroy a normal magical item (wand of negation, Mordenkainen's disjunction, etc.) have no effect on items produced by a masterwork chant.\n\nWhen the months of effort are finished, the master smith must make a nonweapon proficiency check using his blacksmithing, armorer, or weaponsmith proficiency score, as appropriate. If the check succeeds, the masterwork is a success; if the check fails, the work is fatally flawed and must be started over. In either case, the attempt is so exhausting that the master smith cannot attempt another masterwork chant for 10 years.\n\nThe material component for a masterwork chant are a miniature hammer and anvil made of mithril (worth 1,000 gp)."

Should the roll fail, the creature cannot travel more than 20 feet from where the nail/shard is embedded, cannot touch the component, and cannot flee to the Astral or Ethereal Plane.

        "Introduction": "A priest can place float upon his person, an object, or any single creature. The priest can float a maximum of 200 lbs. per level of experience. When cast, the spell causes the priest, object, or creature to float upward toward the surface of the water at a movement rate of 3. This movement rate is in addition to or subtracted from any other (e.g., a priest or creature that normally has a swimming movement rate of 12 can swim toward the surface at a rate of 15, or dive for the bottom at a rate of 9). Horizontal movement is not empowered by the spell, but the recipient can still swim or be pulled laterally. Once cast, the spell requires no concentration and the caster can cancel it at will. If the subject of the spell is unwilling, or the object is in the possession of an unwilling creature, a saving throw vs. spells is allowed to determine if the float spell affects it. This spell works only in liquids or liquified matter (water, quicksand, molten lava, etc.) and cannot cause objects or creatures to float into the air. Objects affected by the spell will float on the surface of the water for the duration of the spell or until the spell-caster negates it. Creatures affected by the spell will also float on the surface but have the option of swimming or diving. The spell does not empower any creature with water walk or free action abilities.\n\nThe reverse, plunge, causes objects to sink into the depths (movement rate as above). The plunge spell can be devastating to ships and swimmers. Naturally, a float spell can be used to counter a plunge, and vice versa.\n\nThe material component is a small splinter of driftwood for the float spell or a small pebble for plunge."

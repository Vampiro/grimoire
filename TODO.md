# TODO

- have a notion of whether a spell is learned or not (so a separate list for the user from spellbooks)
  - user can only prepare learned spells from spellbook
  - allow them to learn/unlearn (in case of mistake)
- add some kind of spell explorer where you can see a list of all spells and get to their descriptions
- add ability for priests to choose spells
- fix all apple pencil issues
